  &lt;p&gt;Did you get a phone call from your customer saying they want to improve their application reliability while you move their workload to the cloud? If yes then continue reading this article. I will use Microsoft Azure to explain the Reliability concept and its improvement steps. You can certainly do the same in Google Cloud or Amazon AWS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-reliability&quot;&gt;What is Reliability?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well reliability is a derived concept. Basically you want your application to be available for your customer. Also you should ask what latency is acceptable for your application. If your application is slower or normal, your application users should not keep retrying to finish any transaction. How should your application fidelity be while your application is slow and not rendering properly. So in order to define reliability of your application you have to answer how much your application should be Available and what is your Latency that you want for your application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Reliability = Availability + Latency
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically reliability is something your Business has to define. You must talk to your customer and understand what kind of business they are running, what problem they want to solve, who are the target users for the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-increase-reliability&quot;&gt;How to increase Reliability?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reliability of your workload is a shared responsibility between you and your cloud provider. Platform Reliability such as datacenter, network and other hardware infrastructure is your cloud provider responsibility. However, application reliability is customer responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to increase application reliability you must do below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Choosing and Configuring correct cloud building blocks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your application must be cloud aware. Like your code should have Retry logic to make sure that application is handling transient failures which is common in the cloud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;right-building-blocks-to-increase-reliability&quot;&gt;Right Building Blocks to increase Reliability&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you choose the right infrastructure building blocks in the cloud to protect their reliability impacts. You have to isolate the concerns and identify them like below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Isolated VM failure such as OS, disk HDD(hard disk drive)  issue.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hardware failure such as server rack issues.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Entire datacenter failure such as power/network issues.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Entire Region failure such as natural disasters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to protect VM disk and OS issues you need to use Premium Storage from Azure Cloud. To protect from hardware failure you must create a VM inside the Availability sets. To protect from entire data center failure you must consider deploying your workload in multiple Availability Zones. Also to protect from natural disasters make sure you deploy your workload in another region as well. So in summary you have to choose correct building blocks as per your requirement to improve reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NmAPF2RRL9cWnGNk2trA4CDiJYP1T94JKw6eCDdIaiMh6cK-cDmxK5L-kFXm6arB43AGSYdXRrJ9NknkOoNxp6xavK_8DQohHvWjJDwkYWthLHm59aQYzUcNkjcjUSh7sw1cvqQy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-improve-reliability-of-an-existing-workload&quot;&gt;How to Improve Reliability of an Existing Workload?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start backup for your virtual machine, databases that you can enable for existing resources in Azure cloud. However, if your VMs are not in the Availability set then you can not put them in the availability set for existing resources. You have to do workaround and re-build some of them and put them in Availability sets again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to improve reliability of existing workload you must follow below steps on each use case:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find Key components for the critical use case (which business is more concern)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Failure Mode Analysis for the critical use case&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Calculate Composite SLA for the critical use case&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improve Composite SLA to meet business requirement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;failure-mode-analysis-technique-for-reliability&quot;&gt;Failure Mode Analysis Technique for Reliability &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First you should talk to customers to find out which business capability they want to be up for what time. Example the purchase application written as asp.net needs to be up for 99.99 and 4 min per month down time. If business defines this then next you must learn their existing workload design consideration to achieve 99.99 SLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing for failure is the philosophy to take while designing applications in the cloud. Exploring what happens if something fails? Take the architecture, look at the portions of the application piece by piece and apply failure mode analysis. Break this down into your solution as a series of key processes. Like in your application, the customer goes and searches for an item to buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-1-find-the-key-components-of-the-business-use-case&quot;&gt;Step 1: Find the key components of the business use case&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now let’s search what component has to be working to make search possible?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fo below architecture example in order to make sure Search is working below components must be up and running&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;AKS with .net application&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Products service&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cosmos DB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/f4_vi4hkaP9Mm_CegNb3EIdZJi4sdcP6M5V4N4UN3hQx9xv6d2EzAgXgfGsl_Pt2fp2XjeWY8a691sTLYNE46L-XBLkWtaMp8euwTTKE3d-WfPKCQvTTDn8VYk1vFvsZORVVDv4j&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-2-failure-mode-analysis&quot;&gt;Step 2: Failure Mode Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try to write down each component failure mode and their effect, impact and chances and work with your customer to learn more. This is a collaborative effort. Solutions Architect and Customer together must do this to come up with correct decisions.  For search use cases you want to check what happens if AKS is unavailable, Website is slow, CosmosDB unavailable for read and update use case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AKS&lt;/strong&gt; is unavailable so we have to change the SLA to 99.95% on the API server of Kubernetes which is a controller plane. This is the SKU version we have to upgrade. In the worker plane we have a VM whose SLA is just like regular.  So businesses have to think of their own requirements to opt in if they want to upgrade the SLA or kubernetes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web site&lt;/strong&gt; is down, because of fluctuation of load due to holiday session. Probability is unknown. So you must use a monitoring tool setup alert to learn more about this kind of problem. LOAD OVER TIME can be only learnt by monitoring and it’s trends.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cosmos DB&lt;/strong&gt; can not read or update. Cosmos DB has 99.99% SLA for a single region. Cosmos DB can not be updated so customers can not see the latest catalog, it is also covered by 99.99% SLA out of the box by Azure cloud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/iu8LobbMlbCm015XHh-IK0LDNnCgnpcy4fci8U2yyfL0CqeXKbllaoobPBFa3aUnRny_HuJevOw2g3W-XlZyuKOn7l4j2ogKzdhFrWhEvco1cz9ALewb8MHlbKStECxoTR3XOLKh&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-3-calculate-composite-sla&quot;&gt;Step 3: Calculate Composite SLA&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AKS SLA is 99.95% and Cosmos DB SLA is 99.99%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So overall composite SLA of AKS and Cosmos DB is 99.99 x 99.95 = &lt;strong&gt;99.94%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/GCIAG58M95wm2POxLK8YbpqaPsmb_V-znzAPJ7-hcE_00BWNV3l4WTNCv7IjuHLiERLMkxy0-8nfVEDsdAVf776lQj3I15NdqVRF1k5XiXdBjhu2KCMfO-XVmqoyi7p07swRy3Rq&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-4-how-to-increase-composite-sla&quot;&gt;Step 4:  How to increase Composite SLA&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To increase the composed availability add redundancy to the solution. Let’s make 2 AKS, if one breaks the other will work. You can put them in multiple Azure Region East/South USA. They have to be identical. Deployment of the cluster and the containers would have to be deployed in an automated way to keep them identical. IAC (Infrastructure as Code) should be in a repository and used to deploy your resources. Since AKS is in multiple regions you need DB in both regions. Cosmos DB has a multimaster database you can use in 2 regions so any change you do in one region is synchronized in both regions out of the box.  You have to use Microsoft &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/front-door-overview&quot;&gt;Front Door&lt;/a&gt; to route between multiple regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) with redundant will give you SLA 99.99% per region with multiple region SLA is 99.999975%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Front Door SLA is 99.99%&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cosmos DB with multiple writable region SLA 99.999%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Composite SLA&lt;/strong&gt; = 0.99999975 x 0.9999 x 0.99999 = &lt;strong&gt;99.99%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FfWkyWrjFJtX4F-lFVnBJWvy-8VmvLHrKxGjbibArAZ6VmeaZQsvTysSbFuG6B4TR8hSsL8AkGLzvo7vhk6gHPlnkQ-ajJH7gSlYKBlvVkjCjSps-HPT62EDogXQrqSyW-kWkSTJ&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-know-if-something-is-wrong-in-your-web-app&quot;&gt;How to know if something is wrong in your web app?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create alert rules specify conditions and for actions you can alert humans with sms, or create action groups and execute some azure functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_D_EY_Jkd2qcVom9MCo4xRthm8E0rTF2iOW9ib_kLSMr3s1f1mWaPaFZ66AhVNEObFywS1qApOPG6PtaDwaks3ZJsU-5NJ33jT0j0OJFvF4ucF9cze8Gul6AfTyiigzA0d3g25BA&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enable-vm-replication-for-improved-reliability&quot;&gt;Enable VM Replication for improved Reliability&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to backup lots of customers are focused on disaster recovery and making sure the workloads are redundant and not just backed up. Meaning that if we had a planned or unplanned type of outage. Planned means upgrades to different applications, or we are testing our disaster recovery  or may be unplanned like some natural disaster or things of nature. So introduce resilience in the form of  being able to access backups that are in another region and to make those come online as quickly as possible to make sure that we reduce downtime to the extent possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;upgrade-vm-to-premium-disks-to-increase-reliability&quot;&gt;Upgrade VM to Premium Disks to increase Reliability&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For production workloads, especially Big Data, SQL and other transactional DB upgrades to premium disk instead of standar disk offering. Premium disks also offer bursting capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burst means performance on heavy load.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On-demand bursting: you pay whenever you have burst. When you have an inconsistent workload.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Credit-based bursting:  Harvest or credit yourself with additional bursting capability when you are operating below the maximum thresholds that we have. In this case, you’re able to burn those credits by bursting when you need it without any other cost implications. So you accrue your bursting credits when you are not using them and use it when you need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;upgrade-vm-to-managed-disks-to-increase-reliability&quot;&gt;Upgrade VM to Managed Disks to increase Reliability&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Un-Managed Disks where you have to set the size, throughput limit, and add more resources to scale are called unmanaged disks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However in Managed Disk you get below processes automated for you by your cloud provider:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set the size, throughput limit, add more resource to scale handled by azure&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Abstract the entire management layer of storage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Compatible with availability set and availability zones, you get 99.99% availability for production workloads.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Resiliency : 3 replicas across multiple hardware devices&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Granular role based access control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-i-know-what-i-dont-know&quot;&gt;How do I know what I don’t Know?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to have a long term learning process. Just wait for another disaster, unexpected event and learn. The other option is to simulate/force failures and see what happens. Say stop AKS and check if your redundancy is working. Take a more experimental model, introduce real world scenarios and see how our workload works. Game day, setup scenario, one team generating un-predictable load by un-usual way, another team observing, are we seeing alerts are coming, are we seeing redundant machine status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to get Reliability increased for your customers workload you must speak with them and understand their critical use case which they care most about. Follow the steps that I suggested in this article to come up with the desired reliability state defined by business by doing failure mode analysis in depth one by one for each important use case. You may have to teach your customer about premium disks for VM and their SLA improvement because of upgrading to premium disk. What is managed and unmanaged disks after migrating to managed disk resilience can be increased since it automatically replicates the disk into 3 multiple hardware devices. Consider replicating virtual machines to protect them from regional outages. Setup Azure Virtual Machine backup for improved reliability and to protect from human error or DB corruptions. Also make sure you set up alerts for your applications to send you email or create zendesk tickets whenever it is down. I hope now you have a good understanding about reliability improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In a traditional data center you create one perimeter, secure them by installing firewall, WAF, SIEMS etc. and have 100% confidence that the data center is secure. However, when you migrate to cloud then your VPC or Virtual Network is not 100% secure you have to not only secure your perimeter however, inside of perimeter you have to take care of security. Since it’s a public cloud you have to be more cautious and make sure whatever workload or source code you are moving to is cloud aware. There are various best practices at each level you have to take care of in order to secure your cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-defense-in-depth&quot;&gt;What is Defense in-depth? &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a concept of Defense in-depth which makes sure that at each level there is security in-place which makes your cloud data center almost 100% secure. However, it needs continuous awareness, assessments and audits. In this article let’s explore how Azure helps us to secure data centers in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defense in-depth design of azure services and capabilities to help you secure, manage and monitor your cloud data, infrastructure, compute Azure offers unified security management and advanced threat protection for your cloud, on-premise data centers or both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/vnX_FyeIYoghC9nnzuhYRmZlfep0AaHXTY0VfyH8mr2zy-JD4PSrFGyqqOSfRUGBn7WciGid8T3nGQm4ZPMdM8Qv5XYkviRwTUJ1vKUIL971w5AyxavBM14DoCiWYTBLrIhG54C1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you want to secure your cloud you should think of securing from the physical layer till your data layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defense In-depth security layers are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Physical Security ( within your data-center )&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Policies and Access / Identity and Access Management&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Perimeter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Networking&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Virtual Machines/Compute&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Applications&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;microsoft-azure-security-center&quot;&gt;Microsoft Azure Security Center&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Microsoft Azure all resources and services are designed to keep Defense in-depth in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure Advisor in Azure helps us to maintain our workload to follow well-architected-framework guidelines by showing overall score. Similarly &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/defender-for-cloud-introduction&quot;&gt;Azure Security Center&lt;/a&gt; helps us to do defense-in-depth and it shows the all score of your cloud security health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ruC9kWhf2WcpDIFBNy6ZpQ5KSDtnxxQbb7y4J0TYTo96YnACCHif8JFRdTReNj9ecwd-JNSmsYCKOZoBtaOa3KObRKrG6ADUVcZMEPYIWXuDXc3DgBywQtTnlSCwCEWL-plV2aNj&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security center has a lot of practical recommendations and quick fixes to keep our workload protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure Security center provides unified visibility, control and adaptive threat protection to the resources. So if you add any new resource they will be automatically under threat protection and detection policies. So they are secured from all network attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/eBAkNh4BM0mJ1f9vV2xSVDYjGY-vbxlEu3XOfTcSS6uijG4hpiTc4dwQ6UVndv6G_Tp_SmhwtzVg70LcsM-5JHki3kQGlgRUYLNrIuLjZ1C_OyswNjzrOOxtxFRA5Jhwx85pk7zR&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally Azure Security Center has &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/threat-detection&quot;&gt;Intelligent Threat Detection response&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/RwFiOhDn3NJnVHZ1HKqeMX_k14lo5wfBzT0zqwx7vhDFGB0b3XkIrVbniuGC3K2qN0qJ6nLLz_m_gH5rdu7mKTiGqeJhOAvcmD_ze4CGShDp1uU4u8u4NAXWQqCEJB-VziQ_Dusg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s understand how we would set up defense in-depth in the cloud starting from physical layer security up to data layer security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;physical-security&quot;&gt;Physical Security &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For physical security of cloud Infrastructure cloud providers are responsible. Therefore as a customer we should not be worried about securing physical data centers, racks, wire etc. Azure data center security is at high top priority. Cloud providers like Azure or AWS or Google Cloud are responsible for “Security of the Cloud” - Azure is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the Azure Cloud. This infrastructure is composed of the hardware, software, networking, and facilities that run Azure Cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6x-PZcvjmkvzOCCDTOBMHaY1Hm5vvp0wO-qpFIObr-8gb6RWNZoAb8UaZgif-oP2SRjedOXH7O9o7awgq33aaQCsbbKIZUX080XkBvv1j_0n6VyBSkNwUtVV15jzu6BPlPuVDMvJ&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;policies-and-access&quot;&gt;Policies and Access&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/W0s8GBrFCn3oGBplWL-3CkVdELjemy_kp65eoEk8whNqvQ6wmgll3IoKc4DyPrlt9t5AeKMER9Apn-nXYvwN9kFS6EPqLsPIkU5ZPkiW-YgLQP7oLseB-1TH61ZEY0lYg3_OPUuv&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Azure everything starts with  Identity and Access. All Azure resources ( Network, Compute, Apps, Data etc.)  are governed by Azure Active Directory. You can also add policies and Role based access control for each individual resource in your cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/zFLkL5WpWCEkrfmcCLg8mOsz2oQO4XZC8MbnpFEy_CxUE4Vg4zZqFpZDnMrShnkDws_ZtafiJIpS6eP6WjZIDjudAaPWbuyDNyEF2Ab3MIsiBjLaq4yxLECQR3fjctDn7Y_7aMVF&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure has a separate service to manage security policies and access to resources. Weather accessed by people or programs by REST API calls to your resources. This can control which processes can access your application files or data and granular access is delegated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xyukF8A8HBqNsFmjmu6ROYDSy_SJ_2qiJWTWXFmYl9PVo2yxBs8C1HR3pd1Nm1sn5L4Nf30AL8Ul48c-rbR4J-gkXBNJgExzROrnqTIyBf3ncykLwOIJp9BcvEB09993lVa5_KEi&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These controls are the front door of your environment. Your IT can make developers as contributors, marketing users as readers and so on by applying role based access control (RBAC). Role could be owner, contributor or reader and many other in-built roles are available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/zwLWOxEd1TKSFbsPziMIAJdbmc3A-I-URI21AjebsNPezKWoCRrWB79ujtZD7UkD4pXFi_S7pIpnF_v6C1Bx5u0l1o5Cg7YiKv0z_L73DWbbTWcYDUydyKuxeFFVvL3wKKzAMyqI&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;perimeter-security&quot;&gt;Perimeter Security&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/srZpu7GCTkioKhComoj0lB1qJ2kp8rqytWL614pZplxDGpCBhHZlfbJzcL1ya5t5JQtGHvapSG8vC4bGK44fpJfwKIierON8ZIMZNh8xmQbWg4-PYi9LQTqU46R_9yGHRjRSSQwl&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perimeter networks in the cloud enable secure connectivity between your cloud networks and your on-premise or physical datacenter network. Perimeter network is also called a demilitarized zone or DMZ. The number of DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service Attacks) over 100 GB/s in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.comparitech.com/blog/information-security/ddos-statistics-facts/&quot;&gt;volume increased 776 percent in Q1 2020.&lt;/a&gt; In a DDoS attack, a perpetrator intentionally floods the system, like a server, website, or other network resource, with fake traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to secure your perimeter in the cloud you must set up a Firewall. You may want to also install IPS (Intrusion Prevention Systems) &amp;amp; IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems ) to detect and prevent unwanted traffic and block not requiring ports and IPs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also you must protect your perimeter from Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Every property in Azure is protected by Azure’s infrastructure DDoS (Basic) Protection at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/HWtudjFgAQZSNr0Y2MhD_vqN5VyqBWJW-gXEeDzHCSW6qop7yKcIyRIxEtQFNMJ7j4_56fOOfUpMKPcUH9BcG9Glq5O00B8LJadQQTySCywK5gZEmae1xl_wtbMTRjiX1AIiPgoc&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/2jPvLCp15Ld7pEJXg-unikeb6NU1I7jfh6dTUGuM3ouohJZIfVDljvrbuhoLSAkHsPt7D7CL4p3zHA6UNtLBt-iXKRV_XBcc-lAgv08Bpx2C6-XrJWm8Vl9WeeX3MlcV-1cdRyq4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Layer-7 DDoS protection can be achieved by using &lt;a href=&quot;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/ddos-protection/#documentation&quot;&gt;Azure’s DDoS Protection&lt;/a&gt; for protection against DDoS attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure DDoS protection will save from protocol attack where the attackers tries to find and exploit weaknesses in layer 3 (Network) and 4(Transport) stacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/SgItOoTz0lqyUTFmYMGtBPiTPpzvpEggFDTAgEfS0M8rCVARiclWRimVrtCg5uqw7xYtEJDVBvZCO6fhyH7Lb92aYF5Lw2j4EmS9lFAKGI5TuWsAsgrbs5_3J0C_CMAns-NuC2kh&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Application attack where the application packets are used to disrupt transmission of data between hosts like cross-site scripting or HTTP protocol violation attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-TRCxfIU2zD1YXEYJ7FCUAjnPI2e1Z724VFNLNErsLzGBvE2FRtjShc8WKNUOY2k9tkbRP4m9T3OSM6KhcUI5vMt3pZalD7IemoPmdGIpbepYW-XoSAQFEwnvqQhTCTi5dUW8h4E&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;network-protection&quot;&gt;Network Protection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oEyHwqk9JSt51qOeh47jEccKkAzOUgQ__XcK75rH-5qcAjvSUBUWZq2iZYgETe5oAmPH4WfaRJUwQJRu8ocIvsFmvQ1BqrB0sEHuaAjRCQp0a26zBICgb1e9MyDu5c7j_NwTfML6&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure Security center will report on potential network and security issues related to open ports and firewall settings and Network Security Groups (NSG). You can enforce logical network boundaries and limit permissions to NSG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With enabled network watchers you can quickly go to the my network diagram page and check the diagram for the selected virtual network, select the desired subnet and open/close port or block IP addresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/b4ZBLVK9nJ5LQRfRKU8N7T9Jhu2dg_X-HDT4Hx8Q71JhVEqw8zM1pfZ0F-6vLeazZ4-M2PtSahZaezAqjm112TC2dBTtbiHEAUhyrdGO7N5ftgWrV8oeiWtbPOEamkD00v7CvoGK&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I select the backend subnet and then I can see all of the network security group (NSG) and identify the desired NSG to analyze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QPZULg1mwiklJNjBrfkIaGKgl2m8rxJ2z4yOi9mBOa_jAuUGrmBjWLsTriGkWK0dPRTV-LZfRBhCuNR2m58bNXvny4rAxHJmx_i5Ro48g6G466De9QiYkPLcLEwBkxIhtO3xbB20&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I get into the NSG page for a desired subnet then I can manually enable/disable ports or range of IP addresses. You can also enable just in time port access for your virtual machine and manage open ports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ICawWtuXweQcUm3_8xxqRJ-I-Yb412SFbHSXsAQJaAMSHWI_mJwnaYAT3mnk2e_q13Ts0snemP7lgR8yyerxeUcpya-2NSgmRy4Tg8k6x54AwfbPVVYVXFS9grcA8mPYYPAXsKye&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With intelligent recommendations to reduce exposure to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack&quot;&gt;brute force attacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, your network in the cloud can be protected by enabling monitoring, encryption and network segmentations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;compute-protection&quot;&gt;Compute Protection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compute means your Virtual Machines and such (IaaS) things in the cloud. Azure Security Center will also provide an actionable item list for your virtual machines. Tell you what the patches are pending with their severity using machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/7-QWjkor6rRvSqmvztq3MC8gQv5zRL1jOBCVL6a2qQVLupdkkorETOSYM9FAnKa0nsDDlVZK2gx2mu6AhZHsaJVfUyjVxw0JzHWyW3xEayD-2V0MagNj8ws_BPj576AZxAV1ydkV&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should set up NSG on the Virtual machine NIC (Network Interface Card ) and secure it by disabling port or IP addresses if required. So that it will keep unwanted traffic out of the host.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you have installed proper antivirus in the Virtual Machines. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/iaas-antimalware-windows&quot;&gt;Microsoft Antimalware for Azure&lt;/a&gt; is free real-time protection capability that helps identify and remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software, with configurable alerts when known malicious or unwanted software attempts to install itself or run on your Azure systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Single SignOn is another feature that prevents users from entering passwords and protects us from various security attacks. Use Azure Active Directory authentication and Managed identity that includes System or User Defined Identities to auto authenticate other processes trying to access your virtual machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtual Patching is another workaround that we should use to protect existing legacy applications installed on cloud virtual machines. Legacy applications are not cloud ready and they have various vulnerabilities. Most of the time we do not have permission/bandwidth/budget to modify them. At that time to protect them in the cloud we can use virtual patching. Many 3 party extensions are available from azure marketplace for that. Virtual patching works with WAS and WAF together. It uses WAS( Web Application Scanning) to scan installed applications in the virtual machine and whenever it finds a threat it creates an automatic rule in the Web Application Firewall (WAF). This security option is best for many lifts and shifts of legacy virtual machines or physical machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Azure Security center uses machine learning to continuously assess security and vulnerability levels of your Virtual Machines, Networks and service configurations. It also gives you actionable recommendations to prevent exploits before they occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example of Virtual Machine recommendations by Azure Security Center are as below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apply a Just-In-Time network access control&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enable NSG&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apply Disk encryption&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apply System updates&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Restrict access through internet facing endpoint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/LZyrRC0vuRzAIk-eGRYkB04C4kAbHctU3BqFOHR3E43GMxVuDJosv5I2yH7r9qhkSwNWWChrAgW30bG9-jjRxsdXHtmoQc-GkBx88Fg4UJUs0aqe8JWKCyobSA2zrBXElj65-7sC&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure  Security Center has Adaptive Application Control that dynamically applies both allow and block lists to keep unwanted traffic out of your virtual machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/jSIG8VJfAlHW8XMihUC2_-dDZJd6-yf0_YKqOS2gGFwhMViU6KskOMn16w0eaNWy1sV4TJkYZeM6T-YuPmG5TCfquu1NkrWNDCoc8O8s9k5rXzWFDhxOnMPXmSwH6HLmRhAvB9lp&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are using Hybrid Cloud still you can leverage the Azure Security Center features for your on-premise or  3rd party cloud resources. Because Azure Security Center gives many features for your VMs in other clouds and in your data center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/w3nVZsAZMdIrNweOVxGjTDchCACkOZirqoOOo435qJZsHsChKypEJ_r0n-qSgVyweOjKCPxmQH5LGhFM1bOKyX0lWexWg8hh1nLWcAxlAxopAfvj9CM15_zg1iArsh58J6_PABVK&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can implement Intelligent Threat Detection and Response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/8ZQdTANFJN_8jsAy_u9uKs-yLy2YvfUb2UU48pUsfye2fCb3rsHU8gqJpglU7WGlFKoDt3ikdRaHar61BE3tvTJJekNxJuOvYS3bm6A-cdZFZ4A2TTXD_LPVcWjVVnia1hipbYQX&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The security center leverages the Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph to discover and take action against attacks. It combines cyberintelligence that Microsoft collects across all of its services and industry data to block known attack patterns. You can also prioritize alerts and incidents that are important to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/jvh9AeHoqP4CrjHG5yzc7rp9LoL7tQA0y5kZpEEPvNxjFsbhQX5KQ_rXOr83VNPKkrIl2GxZOC3-AFEIztNjb7boSz1J77wDUfQlzJ03lc82xot6aDUL3C1DJM3CKlBtlZRnJpws&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also get a unified view for forensics analysis and the ability to search across all of your compute resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/8Cj9H6tZTO9V6tDB-K6kwlBLNYbyPZ3kJlHBB1tJJkzljzt1ynlasBJGPm6jciWNueT8lHRVadJ61hASdBnAfdg799S45NFFxcVOdVfIRlZTom_BXddFC_TnvryI-GAxjFZcv0Pm&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also configure the sys log, setting the advanced threat analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/7z8yvlksVrU4vwYIUm_w9wSHrUOfrggbK2RXbBQJUWkXoxXc8GMTnLHBfIynzmZq2T7B_mGhZCiTgA-0IuJNx6z1g1xRL3dLEuPvhKboa-r2I36utECJFX6vjZ473O1EcaIFv_Ue&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can even visualize threat intelligence&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/7GV-Bl0qbpKnzUb0ncAW2wwHYUkMpYlxzNJCyHzPmyrN28xEDXZI_gWiTDeyGXP9VC7RUPVu21hiaHwo_oI73q3VaZqoMbRIcjFkZT_5DswNglQC4YLajfuP2303Pn-rND3qHYff&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Threat Intelligence Log Search will show you the tracing for even most trending attack techniques and the geographic regions affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/FsnxlZWavD8rtxz2JDVJx0Uh42Ye9YBmnpqqgopqgoa4uYc-DRqJAyp-P3E0hQWn-_kovdDPvi3Fg3Bw154cykOhtPmBsv2abPh9xNRKuoEbekSpFeuvzRFLb2bNfyTJUgpVYQrD&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;application-protection&quot;&gt;Application Protection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/WkCU8ENZvUKyrIsgeitfdkSoLKZ5sIIeXx-l-wG7GqdGNxfljmodVVC9tZe8nmf9TqFg-xD0_cMHwcnP-4-Xcxhk7c6WFpgRJuF1RvN6DPQ-ceesbLPA89UcYzdnuZyOVw3r0E-L&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applications are right on top of the data. Therefore, securing applications is a high priority. Maximum attackers are looking to attack applications only.  We can do below things to protect our applications&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SSL/TLS, HTTPS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Single Sign On&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Application integrity ( adhering to the policies like following NIST guidelines )&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vulnerability Scans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applications installed or used in Azure cloud for accessing and presenting data. Application securities are governed through data, Virtual Machines or compute (IaaS) and platform (PaaS) services in Azure. Web applications can use azure Managed Service Identities to streamline secure communications with other services in Azure connected to Azure Active Directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/B38z9MJiPn4TGje_O2Dw1ncenCsp80skbgp9w2x9Xh_LSHFNoBAo-MUeOA5oSruenzZeS5-Mal9vCxriDJZGIlauSmh6-4dxgdZ1XY36nP6K9XR2zC6Z9EP78r4kSZ9EehsMWusm&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For your applications to make your data-in-transit encrypted you must enable SSL/TLS. From Azure Web apps you can manage SSL certificates and your app can request a valid certificate for all incoming requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/aS6swqis8f0x9QVa1p45ptE-QoOkhyB2gAdPVZJAxRjsOH4tyKRDGQEqURxloaBZfDUcBY5HOyUNyfLsKHa4cmYzH-fMZphi2gAwQWCjJp8AdoRVJEmLvbCCvBiMWCfsB_7ZbK8x&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-protection&quot;&gt;Data Protection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data protection is the most critical thing. Because it is at the core of your applications and services layer. You must secure your data at rest and in-transit. You can use encrypted volumes to get protected by underline infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/KlnifAjbBE8FlnuLghwEA6Eg8s_bE5W5azVTnF3dNbXJWO5syNrAWy_HnCu6do7O6Z_QYD3-PHqC0gs-9XMP-8FGhxkD9BlktLOPbqZjrZsx7EXfWT0qo0WHGCj19Iw09nDVg1ZP&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of structured or unstructured data their protection is built-in out of the box over Azure cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/x1sYgv-KmQFZPKEZUzbMz74paeiGL4RRjHO2aKCTqFoeSth8x6XrirHDyq4ZiFggV8W2-E7obGfuS1WXX_L90w2zhYmyCH1k3to8WYXg5e5i9r7UId0BgaHtRgsrIbdbJwphXIe2&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;structured-data-protection&quot;&gt;Structured Data Protection&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For structured data, all data is encrypted at rest.  And you can use machine learning already built-in Azure security center to proactively look for and alert you on potential security vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enable Auditing &amp;amp; Threat detection on SQL databases&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enable Transparent Data encryption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/lX7hSL70qigudG3PuWcttAMffG82QDrIMo1gUyAtqDCltHBe_Uxkugyz-ozw8uTewz2NBljLhdCcojqbt4uihJTAdpUt8JsS_LzH6CukkoSrN39Q9E7W1inIeZPt6QxoKamqFoYv&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In SQL server which stores structured relational data. You can enable threat detection on database level or entire server level. Threat detection can be related to data encryption,  enabling in-security telemetry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/n4IyubCpQ_YTzCkULc5ZQ--Ca1hT6CQ5YGQUC3Zp7QtxwrbetwICZ5MQ2WJwsYiUIvY6f-8zAwVvi9Jn4cvJVJkC_PYAQ7ll6KBd1YPIFXi4zRy-WVnmo_6syD9lqT46cXjpuiUl&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the SQL Database service itself there is vulnerability assessment where you can get extensive capabilities to recommend and enable sensitive information discovery and classification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/n3OSbj9ATSvd62_1AjApmu08aAigVAwc0EzI4IvlT5_DJRP5B-5Kk1Yr3_7TEfdhuFRs7uQub-0-rhtuXwSA78QwImUBhMO0LP-X6_4Vb3KdvbYHaSQ72Tm1kEgg1s7DAAvfsmR8&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure SQL database service does dynamic data masks to obscure data fields and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/o6KpDoQ2H7o-ICfwTxu4gYAw9arevhDievkajDKCs58VCLRFzMONUQoAr05WiS2GBiLAEcufFmtL3BLB-5iKJ1tvwmJnolPZgXMb2XMIVaBGEFRux4THygOGA-pyATxp7xDDShLd&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Database service just needs to enable these threat protection then Azure security Center will alert you for any vulnerabilities found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/YwiFtzKgXgP04_k09mqovNccFzWdC42wT-xNfMzweS5sb5AQ3WQhy7FTEOqhJtECvpzM4fO-HXyUUGdrqC7zTJgFa4V7gEMFwrE-nzb1rhsUgwEUrOZd1uuTAgV819eiYhw3aBN_&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;non-structured-data-protection&quot;&gt;Non Structured Data Protection&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non structured data like blobs, files, tables and queues are also encrypted at rest in azure cloud and each account is geo-redundant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/QuAOQ4RtCAIH3eZ5-WivrHKulS2iAe20rsKlwa5_5WtoXClu2B8LQ4nk3jtLaCQJIXVjOUIJdreH8lcEHbyeiAPqVr8EcPYD6hbRte4gColF7rIDbIVgQsBX2vJWa0jZbqzIQCTE&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use access keys to control authentication, Shared access signature for secure delegate access and granular firewall controls to restrict public network access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_K2uqutTalHQG0iCyLRzNkXZCUF9MtBpexeYRLw8TBX2i64QaYiTrYqstm_M9tg6soeZDeKsczQyZVWoSunhUAOaGb3QHa3prbwiW4-vZISyuIupnsjnw6wjKxRkdIOSvUUnjVIq&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure Security Center will report its findings whenever security at risk or protections are disabled by your admin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/vDS4A324c7pmIBqMj5KofsEpSeyb9RtnsRk7XXcOjIv-fK_NUhkV2zVFUQ4wjYytTqRHEEw8zWqcsasTvl-ETP1IrJ64msos0R3f_3HK3udHeHu3WMl1fnLwRsXBWjrPHw8DT89J&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea behind the defense in depth approach is to defend a system against any particular attack using several independent methods. Defense in depth is in-built in Azure cloud and it facilitates keeping the security in multiple layers of your architecture. I am also sure the same kind of facilities are available in other cloud environments like in Amazon AWS &amp;amp; Google Cloud. So it’s a matter of awareness and making your cloud secure by properly utilizing the services given by you cloud provider.&lt;/p&gt;

However, when you migrate to cloud then your VPC or Virtual Network is not 100% secure you have to not only secure your perimeter however, inside of perimeter you have to take care of security. Since it’s a public cloud you have to be more cautious and make sure whatever workload or source code you are moving to is cloud aware. There are various best practices at each level you have to take care of in order to secure your cloud.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/WQWdzrb.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/WQWdzrb.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Cost Optimization with Amazon EC2 Spot Instances</title><link href="https://www.rupeshtiwari.com/cost-optimization-with-aws-spot-ec2-instances/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Cost Optimization with Amazon EC2 Spot Instances" /><published>2021-12-11T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.rupeshtiwari.com/cost-optimization-with-aws-spot-ec2-instances</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.rupeshtiwari.com/cost-optimization-with-aws-spot-ec2-instances/">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Creating cost optimized highly scalable cloud architecture is challenging but it is possible! Using Spot Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances you can save up to 90% of on-demand pricing. In this article you will learn what spot instances and what should be your strategy to use spot instances. Additionally, I will give you scenarios where most of the customers are using spot instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;amazon-ec2-purchasing-options&quot;&gt;Amazon EC2 Purchasing Options&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) offers 3 purchasing options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On-Demand&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reserved Instances&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Saving Plans&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spot Instances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the above Amazon EC2 purchase options are also available in Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). So if you are still in a Multi-Cloud environment still you must continue reading this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally, when you are designing your workload in the cloud. Make sure you combine all three of them to get better performance and huge cost savings. Amazon Auto Scaling Group (ASG) can help you to set up rules and conditions to add the desired type of the instances when set up correctly. You can combine on-demand, reserved and spot instances in a single ASG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;on-demand-instances&quot;&gt;On-Demand Instances&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pay for compute capacity by the second or hour with no long-term commitments. Mostly you will use these instances for the spiky workloads or to define needs of your workload. Example: Netflix uses on-demand EC2 instances at off hours to split, encode the video files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BAd22sC.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reserved-instances&quot;&gt;Reserved Instances&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significant discount (up to 70%) compared to on-demand instance pricing. You should use these types of instances for steady state applications or predictable usages, databases. &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/IYJsC3v5updKOqxDw2n2EdrOW6aG6tAU_D4iS0E-WgwCe0zsOK98aar8fYibwrKCu4CYfszSTxQyhqdjksyYIr14hq4Xgb1fJhXTpVk8IzHRu69ok4uJ19xNh86dWPZ1oAOegL9V&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example: your production servers or database servers or domain controllers that work regularly every year. You don’t want to turn them off for several years and keep these instances for the next 3-4 years or more. Then you can purchase reserved instances, with discounted prices and save huge costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;saving-plans&quot;&gt;Saving Plans&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same level of discount as you get from Reserved Instances however, you get more flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flexibility to access computers across EC2 and AWS Fargate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/e-U_KjFJXnLZkbMpwMNWAd-v4rOxSAdTDg8fDOMxSTGgHfM86RMQoJ7_jjATpQ8BhfhtsK5A1Axx-6VUH56CAyRDJj6o0QTE_IwMUoikFg8bezlCc-fAzZ2f_8nx2cj0vGQ4JMtA&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;spot-instances&quot;&gt;Spot Instances &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spare Amazon EC2 capacity for up to 90% discount compared to on-demand instance pricing. You can use these instances for fault tolerant stateless applications, instance flexible or time-sensitive workloads. Spot instances are identical to on-demand instances in terms of performance, infrastructure platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/61yRh1SvEhkZ2ZMwHTWxlMFWE2T-JOxMax217ZHg6uaUgIRF8FKkpDVtV0SJ1bbPXE2kTAJlwOfwDSzqIQOzOrcnrfwZhK_tfdeoB6dprd1v7d-wDJ4nzs8YenGlPAYk8v8TQUvG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to note is that AWS can reclaim these instances with just a 2 minute notice. Therefore, you must plan for a backup strategy while you are using spot instances. Or try to use the spot instances for the use case where you do not want to store the files, data, state or session. You should do stateless activities on spot instances to be on safer side. Amazon EC2 Spot instances are low cost, easy to use and flexible. In Big Data and Analysis use cases lots of customers are using spot instances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;aws-spare-capacity&quot;&gt;AWS Spare Capacity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon AWS does not reserve a minimum or maximum amount of capacity in spare. However, for the on-demand instances in order to give elasticity AWS has to keep spare capacity. Additionally, when a customer is not using on-demand instances then those capacity AWS keep it for spot customers to leverage the available capacity. AWS offers a huge up to 90% discount to spot customers with the caveat that whenever AWS needs the capacity back from you for on-demand customers, AWS will give you a 2-minute warning and take the server back off from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On average, every week, AWS customers are using more compute capacity on Amazon EC2 Spot Instances than customers in 2013 were running across all of Amazon EC2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;spot-instance-use-cases&quot;&gt;Spot Instance Use Cases&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spot instances are perfectly good for below scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fault-tolerant&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flexible workloads&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Loosely coupled systems&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stateless workloads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all of these above scenarios, you can trade off spot instance interruption with the huge money saving. Many customers are using spot instances for below use cases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Big Data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CI/CD&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Web Services&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;HPC (High Performance Compute)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big Data use cases you might have some state while computing and when you lose the computer with 2-minute notice then your work is interrupted. However, in order to not lose state make sure you are using non-instance state like s3, HDFS, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CI/CD use cases you can use spot instances. In CI/CD server you run build, test etc. Maximum time CI/CD tasks, workflows and pipelines are well capable to handle any kind of server failure. Therefore, a good use case for spot instances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WebServices can use spot instances. If you are designing stateless and scalable web services by creating multiple spot instances putting them behind the load balancer then in-case one machine is taken away by AWS, you have other capacity to server for future requests. Only 5% of the time your one instance will be interrupted by AWS so existing running work interruption chances are there but very less. Since most of the time your work will be finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High Performance Computers (HPC) can use spot instances. In the Finance domain most of the Grid that uses HPC with high throughput computing workloads which is loosely coupled can be done using spot instances. In Grid single node failing does not destroy the entire cluster. Similarly for big data we can use spot instances where anytime interruption occurs it’s just a matter of quickly reprocessing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;spot-market&quot;&gt;Spot Market&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spot Market is the unique combination of instance type and availability zone. The supply and demand of  the instance type in that availability zone is what drives the price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following screenshot shows a price comparison for different instance types. If you see the price history of c5 large instance types over the past 3 months it is pretty stable. In this graph below we are looking at the spot market for 4 different type of instances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/q_tMVbNI0yZn2rtOPE10dc1DmzStsmm_TrGO-wknKHSyj6R_4WVaRyTq8GVhf3m74_Dpl_hH5Cz9CBKB_D3WnE40z3KL0fXf-P_fLvd7ar6BO7xIMnuqSzQJGNAYkPXfnk5Xs2QD&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;spot-instance-best-practices&quot;&gt;Spot Instance Best Practices&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While AWS never runs out of spot capacity it is possible for a specific instance, for a specific zone might not be enough spot instances available for you. Therefore, if you ask for 100 spots you may get only 50 of them. So in order to solve this problem you should not be tied with one type of spot instance rather you should use the spot capacity pool given by AWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally you must plan for interruptions since at 2 minute notice AWS can take back the spot instance from you. Over the last 3 months, 95% of spot instance interruptions were from a customer manually terminating the instance because the application had completed its work. So basically 5% of the time Amazon actually interrupts customers so 95% of time you should be able to work with spot instances without interruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are architecting a highly scalable workload then Amazon auto scaling group (ASG) can help you to select the instance type, spot allocation strategy like cheapest instance, also define the split percentage between spot and on-demand instances and let ASG handle this AWS spot instance take back interruption. AWS will automatically spin up new spot instances. I have seen customers define base on-demand instances and in order to boost their application they utilize spot instances and save on 90% cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either you can set up ASG to spin 100% spot instances on top of the on-demand instances as your base capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/vLP5Kp8O44m7WC6gyh3R4LYLsY__8aKucZS0Gdmjmu2q6zhh3wf0s5Qi7U7QNfFUq4SOL_R12267Z4iZsFZHd1HJVGlLx0cVGMNi0A3GLk_j5c8dl7g9iCUePhW5_ME44JnP75CQ&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many customers also set up ASG to spin 50% spot instances and 50% on-demand instances on top of spot instances. Still keep their base capacity as on-demand instances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/GVQA8D6imd0PjyIGv3VVKM6NwH-G79FWS5q-6M7JervqfwXT2R_I5twCH-qs2HsGMvZtswLABXnM-IYObSuW40FrAYpldcRXZLCRTAm1jXskooOg8A9Lhkx6lCxUFrqkHAes6cS6&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling dynamically reacts to the changing demand and optimizes cost as well. ASG has Fleet management where it replaces unhealthy instances. ASG also has Dynamic scaling to scale on demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to optimize your Amazon EC2 workload combine the purchase options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In order to run steady-state workloads use reserved instances or saving plans,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For bursty, new or stateful spiky workloads use on-demand instances and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For fault tolerant applications, flexible and stateless workloads use spot instances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/PYRzFV0AubudQEFWGltkzw2F8ty_VISvhdUa_ast4DyjOHCssfKzgw1f2PmM6SBm3L04K2bOxAHGYiTk59wd0xgpi4eTgWELvy3tyfD9itGrpXVduqvvpmraspMkyBD8D8k8QZ5i&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bursty-workload-optimization-strategy-with-spot-instances&quot;&gt;Bursty Workload Optimization strategy with Spot Instances &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bursty-workload-example&quot;&gt;Bursty Workload example&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In typical capital market domain different types of analytical workloads are there such as below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Research
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;How to increase profit or reduce risk of a portfolio&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reactionary
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Human or an automatic system determine significant market volatility in the middle of trading day&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Overnight Jobs
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;At the end of the trading day, you collect most recent input for your models and  you run them at large scale&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Model backtesting
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;When you make code changes to the model you need to test the changes with 10-20 years of historical data. High resource intensive workload and you need performance since you want to deploy the model in production as well.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to support such a high bursty workload you need infrastructure to auto spinning spot instances and shut them down once a task is done. You can use your own job scheduler or open source from HashiCorp as below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/internals/scheduling/scheduling&quot;&gt;Nomad&lt;/a&gt; : Job Scheduling&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.consul.io/&quot;&gt;Consul&lt;/a&gt; : Health Check, Load Balancing and Service Discovery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take one high bursty workload example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trading desk running on 2000 core scale to 15,000 core scale during trading hours and overnight it runs about 30,000 core scale. This is the bursty nature of the system in action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User sends the work job to Queue, the auto scaler docker container checks the state of capacity and talks to the provisioning system and spins up a couple of new capacities. Once the queue is drained it submits the request to shut down the extra capacity to the provisioning system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2000 jobs are put on the queue at the beginning of trading day they drain quickly. Then 8000, 15000 jobs are put on the queue they drain quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly at the beginning in order to handle 2000 jobs you need 1000 workers then they all shut down again this is very bursty nature. Similarly at different time spans of the day different sets of workers will spin up like 3000 workers for 2 hours, next 4000-7000 workers for next 2 hours and so on. These are all bursty behaviour of your system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spot-instances-strategy-for-bursty-workloads&quot;&gt;Spot Instances Strategy for Bursty Workloads&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would you strategize your spot market such that you create a healthy and performant workload in this situation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diversified allocation strategy&lt;/strong&gt; across as many instance pools as possible is the key to quickly achieving scale and minimizing the size of termination events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Configure your fleet to start up in multiple spot markets in parallel&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build your Launch spec a large number of spot  markets that you need to accept resources&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It will give you quick fleet whenever you need to compute in high volume&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your instances are spread out across a large number of spot markets with few instances belonging to a single spot market.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;So if you get termination notification from AWS in one spot market it wont impact much in your over workload.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to spin up 32 instances each of 30,000 core clusters of spot instances may take an hour or so. Therefore, if you use multiple spot market pools in your launch specification that can reduce your fleet startup time  to around 15 minutes. Your startup time can be sped up 70-80% with this diversified allocation strategy. So create a pool of instances and diversify them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it as simple&lt;/strong&gt; as possible. AWS gives variety of EC2 instances you can group machines by their features such as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compute intensive&lt;/strong&gt;: high compute capacity category&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory intensive&lt;/strong&gt;: memory optimized capacity category&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standard&lt;/strong&gt;: rest machines can be categorized as standard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way you can abstract out the AWS terminologies, instance types, number of cores etc. Rather you define workload memory intensive if they require more memory during work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build in safeties governors&lt;/strong&gt; everywhere. Tag your resources such that you know which team stakeholders are responsible for the payment. Put a threshold on capacity by applying some policy and governance to not spin 3000 vCore machines if you need only 1000 vCore. If you made a mistake and scale up unnecessary then you will end up paying a couple of thousands extra. Therefore, you have to apply strong governance and safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor &amp;amp; Alert&lt;/strong&gt;: If you have bursty large-scale systems where 30,000 vcore spot fleets and 3 or 4 of them running. However, if  your system is not working then you are wasting your huge amount of money. Therefore, you must set up monitoring and alerts to send sms to the core team to get human involvement to tackle the next set of actions for a critical incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Amazon bill is pretty complex. I am pretty sure every cloud provider bills must be the same structure. You have a lot of things and various associated costs with your virtual machines / EC2 instances. Therefore you must do your own maths and explore your cost in depth. There are many other costs you have to consider, not just the machines. Cost management is not a one day job. You must monitor them very frequently. You can check quarterly and also check future expected bills etc to learn more and tune them. Spot instances are great but power comes with responsibility. So make sure the applications that you are designing to run on spot are fault tolerant, stateless and scalable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can even create a digest for a given subscription and select the desired 5 pillars and weekly you will get a summary of Azure advisor recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-you-know-advisor-score-is-good&quot;&gt;How do you know Advisor score is good?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check the score history by monthly/weekly or days and understand if the score is increasing or decreasing by benchmarking it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to increase score is by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Split your workload that is business critical and make it more reliable by following all recommendations and tradeoff on cost.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Split your workload by environment for production/non-production subscriptions. For a development/test environment, cut your cost and trade off on reliability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-improve-cloud-advisor-score&quot;&gt;How to improve Cloud Advisor Score?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must go to the Azure Advisor and check all of the 5 tabs related to the 5 pillars of a well architected framework and follow the quick fix and recommendations to improve your score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WBYLnMb.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the proposed recommendations that you should follow in order to make your system adhere to a well architected framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;operational-excellence&quot;&gt;Operational Excellence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operational excellence recommendations in Azure Advisor can help you with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Process and workflow efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Resource manageability.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deployment best practices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are the recommendations that you can see in the Operational Excellence tab of the Advisor dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Azure Policy recommendations like add tags, restrict creating resources to certain regions etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Design your storage account to prevent reaching the maximum subscription limit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enable traffic analytics to view insights into traffic patterns across azure resources.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increase vCPU limits for your deployments for Pay-As-You-Go subscription.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;performance&quot;&gt;Performance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The performance recommendations in Azure Advisor can help improve the speed and responsiveness of your business-critical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reduce DNS TTL (time-to-live) on your traffic manager profile to fail over to healthy endpoints faster.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improve database performance based on usage history&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Upgrade library to latest versions for better reliability and performance example storage client library version.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use managed disks to prevent disk I/O throttling&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved VM performance and reliability using premium storage that gives SSD I/o-intensive disk for low-latency high IOPS.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improve MySQL connection management by reducing the number of short-lived connections and eliminating unnecessary idle connections.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use ARM template for template deployment, security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cost&quot;&gt;Cost&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of the recommendations given by Azure advisor to save your cloud cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Yearly Savings&lt;/strong&gt;

How to monitor the cost of your cloud resources consumption? Is there any automation you can do to remind you of your cloud budget expenses, future expected cost? Is there any on-click quick fix to terminate underutilized virtual machines. Well the answer to all of these questions is Microsoft Azure Advisor. Yes, you guessed it I will talk about azure advisor in this article. This is an important topic so stay tuned.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/aPeeiUM.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/aPeeiUM.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Introduction to CAP Theorem</title><link href="https://www.rupeshtiwari.com/introduction-to-cap-theorem/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Introduction to CAP Theorem" /><published>2021-12-09T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.rupeshtiwari.com/introduction-to-cap-theorem</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.rupeshtiwari.com/introduction-to-cap-theorem/">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Are you planning to design your next advanced distributed architecture? Make sure you are aware of the concepts such as high availability, consistency and partition tolerance. The CAP theorem states that a distributed system cannot simultaneously be consistent, available, and partition tolerant. CAP Theorem is very important in the Distributed systems, Microservices architecture, Big Data world, especially when we need to make trade offs between the three, based on our unique customer’s use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CAP stands for C - Consistency, A - Availability, P - Partition tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While building a distributed system you will get 2 things up and running at a time and the 3rd thing you will have to sacrifice. CAP theorem helps system architects to make better decisions to trade off to design distributed systems based on requirement and customer priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AP - If you make the system Highly Available and Partition Tolerance then you will not get immediate consistency. It has to be eventually consistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CA - Consistent and Highly available system will  be not partition tolerant at all times&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CP - Consistent and Partition Tolerant system are not highly available&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though you try to make all 3 features to be available in a distributed system you will have to trade off on any one feature. 
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5ApKUNW.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;availability--partition-over-consistency-example&quot;&gt;Availability &amp;amp; Partition over Consistency Example &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application Twitter is highly available and has good partition tolerance. System has to be shared in a very smart way. So it has to be highly available. Here you can sacrifice Availability. It doesn’t matter if I get the tweet from someone immediately. It’s okay to get after 5 min to receive notifications. However, you should be available and partition tolerant&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;availability--consistency-over-partition-tolerance-example&quot;&gt;Availability &amp;amp; Consistency over Partition Tolerance Example &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Payment service you can not comproosed with consistency where you withdraw the amount and the bank backend when they query and they see a different amount is not acceptable. You can compromise with partition tolerance however, the payment system has to be highly available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-consistency&quot;&gt;What is consistency?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consistency in a distributed system is regardless of the node you pick, data you will get for a query will always be the same. Either you get the latest information or you do not get any information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If service 1 updated N1 and service 2 query N2 it should get the latest info updated by service 1 at N2. 
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wLesuWU.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-availability&quot;&gt;What is availability?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every request that comes to the data store should get a response and it should not timeout. It can fail for authentication authorization but not for timeout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have 4 nodes out of that N3 went down. Any application that is connected should not be directed to N3 and routed to a healthy node. So that your system is highly available. In case your request goes to N3 and the application shows 500 server errors your system is not highly Available. Your system should automatically route the request to the healthy available nodes hence make your system highly available. &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/s-Vx-ep2gasLiH_MSzV8muqDD5t6t-3SqUrULQ-kjQGNFQb8Z9NGGWNsnB2IIMvwmi-wlXnp-kos2ajGdfx5IAZZ_V3cp6z9D7_ynkE_VxILn091s0xXITMo1ui3jQfmdGyVKsj8&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-partition-tolerance&quot;&gt;What is Partition Tolerance?  &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the connection between some nodes break, still every request coming to your server should serve and respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZHFtnBf.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose service updated the user address in N3 and to make the system partition tolerant the new data has to be replicated in all of the nodes. If N4 is disconnected or down so if the same service query the updated latest info of the user from N4 it will not get the latest information. In this scenario your application is still available and partition tolerant however it is not consistent. So whenever the connection is resumed then N4 will be updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;can-we-achieve-all-3-features-in-a-distributed-system&quot;&gt;Can we achieve all 3 features in a distributed system?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scenario-where-you-want-availability-and-partition-tolerance&quot;&gt;Scenario where you want Availability and Partition Tolerance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a given moment a system can’t be consistent if it is highly available and partition tolerant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose if you have 4 nodes. One node gets updated with the latest data. In order to keep our system partition tolerant we have to replicate the data in all of the nodes. In the case of a larger system there could be 100, 000 of nodes and while it is replicating data. If someone query to the node where replication is pending at that time your system will return stale data and is not consistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually all of the nodes will be synced up and you will get the latest info that is called eventual consistency. However, there is a certain period of time when the system will not be consistent. In Twitter You must tradeoff consistency however, you must invest on availability and partition tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scenario-where-you-want-availability--consistency-as-high-priority&quot;&gt;Scenario where you want Availability &amp;amp; Consistency as high priority&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For RDBMS suppose you have a Master Slave kind of scenario where you read and write in the primary instance of the database and continuous replication is happening in the secondary database you can use Amazon AWS RDS service. You will have consistency and availability. You do not have partition tolerance. Since you are not sharing your data. When you are making your system like payment, security situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scenario-where-you-want-consistent-and-partition-tolerant&quot;&gt;Scenario where you want Consistent and Partition Tolerant &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose you make changes to N1 and update user info. IF you want to keep it consistent and partition tolerant to then in order for a service to read the consistent data from N3. You have to wait for sometime to allow your data to be replicated fully to N3 till then almost your system is unavailable so in order for it to be consistent your system has to be unavailable means sacrificing the availability part of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the brief period of time you are losing either Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance. That is how eventual consistency is now popular: you are making a highly available and partition tolerant system and make your system consistent eventually. After knowing the pillars of CAP theorem you will be now able to design distributed systems exactly by knowing your customer requirements and concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Point of presence is a fundamental block of the telecommunication domain. You must be aware of this concept. If you want to system design for video content delivery like YouTube, Netflix or Hotstar.com then you must learn what is PoP and how this helps to propagate massive amounts of content across the globe with faster performance and lower latency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-internet&quot;&gt;What is the internet?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet is a massive network of interconnected smaller networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-point-of-presence-pop&quot;&gt;What is the Point of Presence (PoP)?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Point of Presence (PoP) is the Network Interface Point between communicating entities. A PoP is located in a data-center that houses servers, routers, network, switches, multiplexers and other network interface equipment. PoPs are located at colocation centers and Internet exchange points. A PoP is the local access point for an Internet Service Provider (ISP). PoP consists of high-speed telecommunications equipment that  helps customers to connect to the internet via their ISPs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/E4bOvEl.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(image taken from &lt;a href=&quot;https://networkencyclopedia.com/point-of-presence-pop/&quot;&gt;https://networkencyclopedia.com/point-of-presence-pop/&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;point-of-presence-in-action-example&quot;&gt;Point of Presence in Action example &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris is watching Sky News on his laptop, Chris Internet Service Provider (ISP) is Verizon Fios internet service provider. So Chris is part of Verizon Internet’s large network. When Cris types &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.skynews.com&quot;&gt;www.skynews.com&lt;/a&gt; his request first goes to  Verzon’s Point of Presence. But the sky news site is on another network. It is on skynews web servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-network-access-point-nap&quot;&gt;What is Network Access Point (NAP)?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we have 2 different networks. Each one has a point of presence. But how does Chris’s request get on to the Sky’s Network?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need a Network Access Point (NAP) , a NAP is a building where Internet Service Providers can switch information on to each other’s network. Now Chris’s request can get all the way over to skynews.com by using the NAP. And  skynews.com can get all the way back to Chris’s computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/v94nvmL.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there are thousands of PoPs and NAPs all around the world, helping us all stay connected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-colocation-center&quot;&gt;What is a Colocation Center? &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colocation Center is a type of  data center also called a “Carrier Hotel”. Colocation  facilities provide equipment, space, bandwidth for rental to retail customers. Colocation facilities also provide space, power, cooling and physical security for the server, storage and networking equipment to other companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when you are social networking, shopping or surfing the web, you are using lots of interconnected, smaller networks. AWS CloudFront has more than 200 PoP across the globe helping customers to deliver content faster with lower latency and high performance. In AWS PoP also provides DDoS Protection, Attack Mitigation and certificates management features. Amazon prime videos are delivered via AWS PoP only.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;EBITDA and EBIT is a very fundamental financial term that is nowadays mostly considered during the cloud adoption phase for IT companies. If your company is planning to migrate to cloud and you are going to present a finance key performance index to your CFO then make sure you learn these concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadly for any company there exist 3 types of financial statements as following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Balance sheet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Income or Profit &amp;amp; Loss (P&amp;amp;L) Statement&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cache Flow Statement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-balance-sheet&quot;&gt;What is a Balance Sheet? &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balance Sheet consists of  Assets and Liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assets&lt;/strong&gt; are of 2 types Fixed and Current Assets. Fixed Assets which you get the cash value after 1 year example real estate, building,  equipment, vehicles. Current Assets which you convert into cash within 1 year&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liabilities&lt;/strong&gt; are 2 types: Long Term and Current. Long Term liabilities which you have to start paying after 1 year. Current liability which you have to pay off within 1 year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AN9wBPy.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-an-income-or-profit--loss-pl-statement&quot;&gt;What is an Income or Profit &amp;amp; Loss (P&amp;amp;L) Statement? &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you subtract your company Expenses from Revenue then you get the profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Profit = Revenue - Expenses
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/iMP6jRA.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The profit that you make as cash is added to the Current Assets in your Balance Sheet. So if you make more profit your cash reserves increase that increases your assets as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-cash-flow-statement&quot;&gt;What is a Cash Flow Statement?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Cash Flow Statement is just like your bank account statement that shows how much money is credited (deposited) or debited (withdrawn) from your bank account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Net Cash Flows = Cash In - Cash Out 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cash In could be in any form of money deposit to your bank account it could be loan, income revenue, friend deposit money. Cash out could be any form of withdrawal from your account for any reason. The net balance of your cash is the net cash flows of your account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bFayiGL.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EBIT &amp;amp; EBITDA is a metric of Profit and Loss statement that explains which company stock is good and which company is performing better at an operational level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;amortization-vs-depreciation&quot;&gt;Amortization vs Depreciation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tangible assets are physical assets that can be touched. Example of Tangible assets are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Buildings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Equipments&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Furnitures&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vehicles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Land&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Machinery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depreciation is the expense of a fixed asset over its useful life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intangible assets are not physical assets, they can not be touched. Example of Intangible assets are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Patents&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Franchise agreements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Organizational Costs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proprietary process such as copyrights like purchasing cost of software license&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bonds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Employees of a company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amortization is the practice of spreading an intangible asset’s cost over that asset’s useful life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-non-operational-expenses&quot;&gt;What is Non Operational Expenses?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non operational expenses are the variables that differ company by company. Majorly below 3 categories of expenses are called non-operational expenses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interest - Depends on the company’s Financing Structure. If a company has taken a large loan then interest is high and vice-versa.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taxes - Depends on Geography&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Depreciation &amp;amp; Amortization - Past Investments. Non-Cash Expense&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-ebit--ebitda&quot;&gt;What is EBIT &amp;amp; EBITDA? &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EBITDA means Earning Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;EBITDA = Gross Profit - Operating Expenses
EBIT = EBITDA - Depreciation + Amortization 

PBT = EBIT - Interest
Net Profit = PBT - Tax

EBIT = Net Profit + Interest + Tax 
EBITDA = Net Profit + Interest + Tax + Depreciation + Amortization 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vehicle Manufacturing Company EBITDA &amp;amp; EBIT Statement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/eND0t6N.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-is-ebitda-important-for-a-company&quot;&gt;Why is EBITDA important for a company?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Net Profit of a company doesn’t describe the financial status of a company. Because, non operational expenses such as Interest, Tax component, Depreciations, Amortizations vary per company. Example some companies might have no loan so no interest so they might show more net profit. Other companies have taken larger loans so their interest rate is high so net profit becomes low. Taxes can change as per geographical area. Depreciations may differ per company based on old/new physical assets. Therefore, you should financially compare companies at operational level only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order for creating a Level &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_playing_field&quot;&gt;Playing Field&lt;/a&gt; you will use EBIT &amp;amp; EBITDA which is used to compare companies on their operational costs. That is the recommended way to identify which company is financially stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EBITDA is mostly considered in heavily capitalized industries like telecommunications, manufacturing, oil &amp;amp; gas etc. industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EBIT is mostly used for service oriented industries like Consulting and Technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-c-level-executives-care-more-about-ebitda&quot;&gt;Why do C-Level Executives care more about EBITDA?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because when you move your company to cloud then you get rid of capital expenses and incur more operational expenses. As capital expenses decrease and operational expenses increase the EBITDA value decreases. In most of the companies C-level executives like CFO, CIO, CEO get incentives, bonus based on EBITDA value. If EBITDA decreases then their bonus money gets reduced. However, IT companies also have data center staff expenses that are being calculated as the operational cost. Since that costs are now reduced or completely removed based on how many data centers your company closes. That value can balance out the EBITDA value and make your c-executives happy in terms of financial bonus money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So EBITDA is the term used by many software IT industries to publish their financial growth. You can check Microsoft Azure EBITDA margin over the last 10 years here in this chart&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Do you have situations where a process is trying to use your virtual machine in the cloud and you want to protect and control the access? Do you want to use cosmos db using your server layer deployed over azure cloud without managing your own identity and passwords? Use Microsoft Managed Identity. In this article I will describe Managed Identities concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First let’s remind ourselves of what service principals are. Below are called Service Principal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Application principal&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Managed Identity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Legacy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-managed-identity&quot;&gt;What is Managed Identity?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managed Identity is part of the authentication process. Managed Identity is a service principal of a special type that may only be used with Azure resources. When Managed Identity is deleted, the corresponding service principal is automatically  removed. When Managed Identity is created the managed identity resource provider (MSRP) issues certificates to the identity internally. So Managed Identities are certificate based service principals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bmKv6pn.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managed Identities for Azure resources (formally known as MSI (Managed Service Identity) provide Azure services with an Identity in Azure Active Directory. Azure services use this identity to authenticate to services that support Azure AD authentication without needing credentials in your code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MRY8iyy.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;types-of-managed-identities&quot;&gt;Types of Managed Identities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Microsoft Azure there are 2 types of managed identities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;System assigned&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;User assigned&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;system-assigned-identity&quot;&gt;System Assigned Identity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BWz8lDS.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure:- User is enabling system-assigned managed identity to the instance of an azure resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An identity is created in the azure active directory that is tied to the lifecycle of the service instance. When the service instance or resource is deleted azure deletes the corresponding identity. Only Azure resources can use this identity to request a token from Azure Active Directory. You can not share this identity with multiple resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BHRAMhV.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can only enable or disable managed identities at resource level. Workloads that are contained within a single Azure Resource workload for which you need independent identities. Example: Application that works on a single Virtual Machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/aEPJ3sI.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;user-assigned-managed-identities&quot;&gt;User Assigned Managed Identities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You create a managed identity as a stand-alone resource called a user-assigned managed identity. Assign it to one or more instances of an Azure service. Identity is managed separately from the resource that uses it and is not tied to the resource lifecycle. It can be shared across many azure resources. You can create, read, update, delete (CRUD) on user-assigned Managed Identity. 
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/a8gGbnJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Example: Workloads that run on multiple resources and which can share a single identity. For example, workloads where resources are recycled frequently, but permissions should stay consistent like multiple virtual machines need to access the same resource. You have to assign 3 system-assigned identities in a shared azure resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/A4O695X.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when you use system-assigned identity then you face 2 problemes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You have to assign multiple identities to the shared resource. Imagine if there are 100 Virtual Machines or so.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whenever VM is deallocated then the corresponding managed identity will be deleted as well. So you have to assign a new system assigned managed identity of the VM when it is again provisioned. So you have to manage your own self.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Therefore, in this situation you should create one user-assigned managed identity that can remain always unless you delete the key.  Youjust assign that key to the azure virtual machines. And the shared resource will only allow that identity to authenticate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can perform CRUD operations on Managed Identity using below tools:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Now a days distributed architecture is common. We deploy our services into many different servers to scale them up and meet our demand. However, managing all servers for &lt;strong&gt;load-balancing, scaling, make application highly available&lt;/strong&gt; is super challenging on cloud. &lt;strong&gt;Azure Virtual Machine Scale sets&lt;/strong&gt; is the great tool which does all of these automatically with &lt;strong&gt;no extra cost&lt;/strong&gt; for you. Lets learn more about Scale sets in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Black Friday sell you want your services to be running in 50 instances and on regular day you want 5 instances. So in cloud Virtual machine scale set you get automatic scale up and down of your VM instances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;scalability-vs-elasticity&quot;&gt;Scalability vs Elasticity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scalability means to increase from 5 to 50 instances. Elasticity is to reduce 50 instances to 5. With VMSS scalability and elasticity is possible automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;vertical-vs-horizontal-scaling&quot;&gt;Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/EkHkAX3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two types of scaling vertical and horizontal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vertical-scaling-or-scale-updown&quot;&gt;Vertical Scaling or Scale Up/Down&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Vertical scaling if you have 1 core CPU and 4GB memory and if you can upgrade this configuration to 2 core CPU and 8 GB memory. This is called as Scale UP. You can reduce the configuration back to baseline which is called as Scale Down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;horizontal-scaling-or-scale-outin&quot;&gt;Horizontal Scaling or Scale Out/In&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Horizontal Scaling is you start with one VM and you keep adding more VM with same configuration is also called as Scale Out. You can also reduce back to 1 VM once your Sale or Business demand is over this process is called as Scale In.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;distributed-architecture-with-scale-sets&quot;&gt;Distributed Architecture with Scale Sets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must need &lt;strong&gt;Distributed Architecture&lt;/strong&gt; to provide &lt;strong&gt;redundancy and improved performance&lt;/strong&gt;, applications are typically &lt;strong&gt;distributed across multiple instances&lt;/strong&gt;. In order to give your customer faster speed and low latency you may need &lt;strong&gt;load balancer&lt;/strong&gt; that &lt;strong&gt;distributes requests&lt;/strong&gt; to one of the application &lt;strong&gt;instances&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-azure-virtual-machine-scale-sets&quot;&gt;What is Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/3qqKpF8.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS) let you &lt;strong&gt;Create&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Manage&lt;/strong&gt; a &lt;strong&gt;group of load balanced VMs&lt;/strong&gt;. The number of VM instances can &lt;strong&gt;automatically increase or decrease&lt;/strong&gt; in response to demand or a defined schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With virtual machine scale sets, you can build &lt;strong&gt;large-scale services for areas such as compute, big data, and container workloads&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scale sets provide &lt;strong&gt;high availability to your applications&lt;/strong&gt;, and allow you to &lt;strong&gt;centrally manage&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;configure&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;update&lt;/strong&gt; a large number of VMs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consistent Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;: Virtual Machine scale sets are the objects that are used to run multiple instances of your application and maintain a consistent configuration across your environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--info&quot;&gt;VMs in a scale set are identical, so you can create them from the same base operating system image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-virtual-machine-scale-set-vmss-works&quot;&gt;How Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS) works&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VMSS uses &lt;a href=&quot;#minimum-instance&quot;&gt;minimum instance&lt;/a&gt; to start with and you can set the &lt;a href=&quot;#maximum-instance&quot;&gt;maximum instance&lt;/a&gt; of your virtual machine. You can setup rules based on &lt;a href=&quot;#time-based-scaling&quot;&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#metrics&quot;&gt;Metrics&lt;/a&gt; based to increase or decrease VM instances. VMSS has in build &lt;a href=&quot;#load-balancer-in-scale-set&quot;&gt;load balancers&lt;/a&gt;. Public load balancer works with internet traffic to your VMs. Which looks upon the CPU metrics and if CPU utilization is more than 75% then wait for some time and add another VM instance without any manual steps required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;minimum-instance&quot;&gt;Minimum Instance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This defines how much instance of VM minimum you need. You can set it to 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;maximum-instance&quot;&gt;Maximum Instance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can go up to 1000 VM instances. For example for your business you can start with 1 VM and scale out up to 3 instances. Therefore, you set Maximum instance value to 3. Therefore, even though the demand is high Azure will not spin up 4th instance. It will stay up to 3 instance only and you save budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;metrics-based-scaling&quot;&gt;Metrics Based Scaling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t know where you are going to get the maximum business, it may be today, next day or any 5 continuous days then you must go for Metrics based scaling. You can set rule like If my VM CPU utilization is &amp;gt; 75% then add one more VM if it is less than ( &amp;lt; ) 25% then remove the VM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manually increasing instances&lt;/strong&gt;: If you know tomorrow only you want to increase your VM instance to 4 instances. So you do that manually and revert it on the day after tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;time-based-scaling&quot;&gt;Time Based Scaling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Custom&lt;/strong&gt; : You can do &lt;strong&gt;Time Based&lt;/strong&gt; increment or decrement Here you can schedule your VMs to scale out and scale in. For example every Saturday increase the VM instance to 4 and on Sunday reduce it back to 1. You can schedule these rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;load-balancer-in-scale-set&quot;&gt;Load Balancer in Scale Set&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/8H6dwMy.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An &lt;strong&gt;Azure load balancer&lt;/strong&gt; is a Layer-4 (TCP, UDP) &lt;strong&gt;load balancer&lt;/strong&gt; that provides high availability by distributing incoming traffic among healthy VMs. A &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/components#frontend-ip-configurations&quot;&gt;public load balancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; can provide outbound connections for virtual machines (VMs) inside your virtual network. Public Load Balancers are used to load balance internet traffic to your VMs. An &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/components#frontend-ip-configurations&quot;&gt;internal (or private) load balancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is used where private IPs are needed at the frontend only. Internal load balancers are used to load balance traffic inside a virtual network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;virtual-machine-scale-set-architecture&quot;&gt;Virtual Machine Scale Set Architecture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS) deploys Virtual Machines in a single subnet of a Virtual Network. Figure below shows Architecture of Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS) deployed in single subnet with Single Placement group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/XUk0AFB.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Virtual Network&lt;/strong&gt; with Single Subnet is automatically created during VMSS deployment. All virtual machines specified in create VMSS blade are deployed in the Single Subnet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Azure Load Balancer&lt;/strong&gt; is automatically created during VMSS deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Placement group&lt;/strong&gt; is availability set with five fault domains and five update domains and support up to 100 VMs. Placement group is automatically created by VMSS. Additional Placement groups will be automatically created by VMSS if you are deploying more than 100 instances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storage&lt;/strong&gt;: VMSS can use managed disks or unmanaged disks for Virtual Machine storage. Managed disks are required to create more than 100 Virtual Machines. Unmanaged disks are limited to 100 VMs and single Placement Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VM Diagnostic Logs&lt;/strong&gt; are guest OS performance counters and are streamed to Azure storage Account. VMSS uses this data for making Auto-scaling decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-use-virtual-machine-scale-sets&quot;&gt;Why use Virtual Machine Scale Sets?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintenance Mode Support&lt;/strong&gt;: If you need to perform maintenance or update an application instance, your customers must be distributed to another available application instance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automatically increase VM instances&lt;/strong&gt;: To keep up with additional customer demand, you may need to increase the number of application instances that run your application.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Auto scale based on metrics.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Auto scale based on a defined schedule. Suppose starting next week you are going to have a heavy peak, for next 3 days. You can define a set schedule. For example, at 9 am on Jan 2nd 2021, increase the VM instance count to 50. And at 9PM on Jan 5th when your peak ends, bring the instance count back to your baseline configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easy to create and manage multiple VMs&lt;/strong&gt; : It maintains a consistent configuration (VM size, disk configuration) across your environment. All VM instances are created from the same base OS image and configuration. This approach lets you easily manage hundreds of VMs without additional configuration tasks or network management. For basic layer-4 traffic distribution it uses Azure Load Balancer. And for advanced layer-7 it uses Azure Application Gateway.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provides high availability and application resiliency&lt;/strong&gt;: If one of these VM instances has a problem, customers continue to access your application through one of the other VM instances with minimal interruption.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allows your application to automatically scale as resource demand changes&lt;/strong&gt;: Like it auto increase VM instances. It can also minimizes the number of unnecessary VM instances that run your application when demand is low, while customers continue to receive an acceptable level of performance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Works at large-scale&lt;/strong&gt; : Up to &lt;strong&gt;1000&lt;/strong&gt; Azure VM, and custom VM images up to &lt;strong&gt;600&lt;/strong&gt; VM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scale-set-saves-money-&quot;&gt;Scale set saves money 💰&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;management&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;automation&lt;/strong&gt; features, such as auto-scale and redundancy, incur &lt;strong&gt;no additional charges&lt;/strong&gt; over the use of VMs. You only pay for the underlying compute resources such as the VM instances, load balancer, or Managed Disk storage.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using scale set is a wiser decision with zero additional cost!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-azure-vm-using-azure-vm-image-builder&quot;&gt;Building Azure VM using Azure VM Image Builder&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/Ut26mIt.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/image-builder-overview&quot;&gt;AZURE VM IMAGE BUILDER SERVICE&lt;/a&gt;, you can quickly start building standardized images without needing to set up your own imaging pipeline. Just provide a simple configuration describing your image, submit it to the Image Builder service, and the image is built and distributed. You will incur some compute, networking and storage costs when creating, building and storing images with Azure Image Builder. These costs are similar to the costs incurred in manually creating custom images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/2diOKki.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/shared-image-galleries&quot;&gt;SHARED IMAGE GALLERY&lt;/a&gt; enables image distribution to different users, service principals, or AD groups, across multiple subscriptions within your organization and regions through a centralized image management platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run below command for creating shared image gallery:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-powershell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;New-AzGallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-GalleryName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;azdemoGallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-ResourceGroupName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Azure-demo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-Location&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;West&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;`
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we need to create Gallery definition for storing windows images:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-powershell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;New-AzGalleryImageDefinition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-GalleryName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;azdemogallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-ResourceGroupName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Azure-demo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-location&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;West&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;winserverimages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-OsState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;generalized&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-Ostype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;windows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-Publisher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;demo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-offer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;windows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-sku&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;win2016&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Azure Active Directory (AD) verifies the credentials that are username and password. It belongs to the Azure Identity Platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-authentication&quot;&gt;What is Authentication?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authentication (AuthN) is the process to prove that you are who you say you are. Microsoft identity platform uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://openid.net/connect&quot;&gt;open Id connect protocol&lt;/a&gt; for handling authentication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-authorization&quot;&gt;What is Authorization?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authorization (AuthZ) is the act of granting an authenticated party permission to do something. Microsoft identity platform uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://oauth.net/2/&quot;&gt;OAuth2.0&lt;/a&gt; protocol for handling authorization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-security-tokens&quot;&gt;What are security Tokens?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft identity provider authenticates users and provides security toneks as &lt;a href=&quot;https://jwt.io/&quot;&gt;JWT&lt;/a&gt; that contains claims .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 3 types of &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens&quot;&gt;Security tokens:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ID token&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Access tokens&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Refresh tokens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2BLbcE1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Id token&lt;/strong&gt;: is issued to the client during open id connect flow. ID token is used to authenticate users. It is provided by the authorized endpoint of the authorization server. It contains claims pertaining to the authentication of the end-user resource owner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access token&lt;/strong&gt;: is issued by authorization server as a part of OAuth2.0 flow. It has information about the user &amp;amp; resource for which the token is issued. Access token enables clients to securely call protected web APIs and are used by web api to do authentication &amp;amp; authorization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refresh token&lt;/strong&gt;: is issued by authorization server at the same time access token is issued. The access token expires in a short time. Client uses refresh token to get next access token.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;validating-security-token&quot;&gt;Validating Security Token&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authorization server signs the security token with a private key; it also publishes a public key. Web api verifies the signature of the token using public key. Client passess access token to the web api as bearer token in the authorization header.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PCRgN6Y.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;security-principal&quot;&gt;Security Principal &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security Principal is a fancy name for various types of security tokens. Below are all called as security principal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;User Principal&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Group Principal&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Service Principal&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Managed Identities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-claim&quot;&gt;What is Claim?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A claim provides assertions about one entity (client application) to another entity (Resource Server). Claim contains facts about the security principal that was authenticated by the authorization server. Claim provides info about below things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Security Token Server ( who generated )&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Date of token creation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Subject&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Audience - Target application for which token generated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-an-application-model&quot;&gt;What is an Application Model?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure AD has identity service and for identity provider to know which user has access to application you must register both user and application in the identity provider. This is the application model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;microsoft-authentication-protocols&quot;&gt;Microsoft Authentication Protocols&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft Identity platform uses the OPENID connect protocol for handling authentication and OAuth2.0 protocol for authorization. 
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jQBYg3z.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Application Registration gives application Id and redirect URI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-bearer-token&quot;&gt;What is Bearer Token?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bearer token is a lightweight security token that gives bearer access to protected resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AbJl7rL.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;security-tokens&quot;&gt;Security Tokens&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 3 types of security tokens:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Access tokens&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ID Token&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Refresh Tokens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0Da1wDj.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/81Mps2M.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LDRXLUo.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-openid-connect-protocol&quot;&gt;What is OpenId Connect Protocol? &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenId Connect authentication protocol built on OAuth. You add authentication to your web app so that it can sign in users. Adding authentication enables your web app to access limited profile information in order to customize the experience for users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web apps authenticate a user in a web browser. In this scenario, the web app directs the user’s browser to sign them in to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Azure AD returns a sign-in response through the user’s browser, which contains claims about the user in a security token. 
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RbLR6P2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;retrieve-access-token&quot;&gt;Retrieve Access Token &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cquFCVf.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the application needs to obtain an authorization code from Azure AD /authorize endpoint. The authorization code can then be used to acquire a new access and refresh token. If the user is not already authenticated, Azure AD /authorize endpoint prompts the user to sign in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7zQ9Q1Y.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;whether the user (or their organization’s administrator) has already granted the application consent. If consent has not already been granted, Azure AD prompts the user for consent&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jMNYK8q.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the user grants consent, an authorization code is returned to your application, which is redeemed to acquire an access token and refresh token.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an administrator, you can also consent to an application’s delegated permissions on behalf of all the users in your tenant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/dRWMdL4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;azure-active-directory-authentication&quot;&gt;Azure Active Directory Authentication&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure Active Directory has below components for authentication:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Self-Service Password Reset&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Azure AD Multi-Factor authentication&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hybrid Integration to write password changes back to on-premises&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hybrid integration to enforce password protection policy for an on-premise environment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Passwordless authentication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;azure-ad-self-service-password-reset&quot;&gt;Azure AD Self-Service Password Reset&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can change or reset passwords without any admin help. Below are the self-services provided:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Password changes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Password reset&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Account unlock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the above activities can be done on cloud Azure AD &amp;amp; these are written back to the on-premises AD. So if you change password it will be synced to on-premises AD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;azure-ad-multi-factor-authentication&quot;&gt;Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During authentication it will prompt additional information. 
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/L6gNomV.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multi-factor authentication needs 2 or more information from below list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Something you know :- password&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Something you have :- Mobile or hardware key&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Something you are :- biometric (fingerprint, face scan )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1W7asfs.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;password-protection-by-azure-ad&quot;&gt;Password Protection by Azure AD&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enforce the use of strong passwords. Azure AD blocks weak passwords like (password123) etc. You can define a custom password policy for your organization. With hybrid integration you can even synchronize policies and weak/banned password list on-premise &amp;amp; enforce them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oN6DpHN.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;passwordless-authentication-by-azure-ad&quot;&gt;Passwordless Authentication by Azure AD&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You provide credentials using&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Biometric with windows hello for business&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;FIDO2 security key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These authentication methods can not be easily duplicated by attackers therefore, they are highly safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-tag-in-azure-resources&quot;&gt;What is Tag in Azure Resources?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You apply tags to your &lt;strong&gt;Azure resources, resource groups, and subscriptions&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;logically&lt;/code&gt; organize them into a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;taxonomy&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each tag consists of a &lt;strong&gt;name and a value pair&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, you can create tag and apply the name “Environment” and the value “Stage” to all the resources in stage. Learn more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/tag-resources&quot;&gt;Tagging ideas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tag names are case-insensitive&lt;/strong&gt;: Example: “Environment” or “environment” they are same tag names.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tag values are case-sensitive&lt;/strong&gt;: Example: “Stage” or “stage” they are different tag values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Get-AzTag&lt;/code&gt; cmdlet to view tag on Azure resource. You have to pass the resource Id though. You can also use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Get-AzResource&lt;/code&gt; cmdlet to view the tags directly under a particular resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-powershell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Get the resource that you want to view tag on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If you have any project that you want to integrate with Azure Active Directory and secure your app. Then you must try using Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL). Yes, in this article I will introduce you to MSAL 🔥.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-msal&quot;&gt;What is MSAL?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) gives secure access to acquire security token on-behalf of user or application and helps you to achieve single sign on. 
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zb53M5t.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MSAL specifies which audience can sign in to your application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-audience&quot;&gt;What is the audience?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Audience is the actor or client who interact with the system to whom your application authenticate. Sometimes audience can be used for the target application for which security principal is generated. Audience could be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your organization&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Several Organization&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work  Organization&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;School  Organization&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Microsoft Personal account&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Social Identities with Azure AD B2B&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Users in Sovereign&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;National Cloud (Sovereign cloud )
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Azure Government&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Azure Germany&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Azure China 21Vianet&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;which-applications-msal-supports&quot;&gt;Which Applications MSAL supports?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your application you do not need to write code, you just install the MSAL library and configure it. MSAL will get the security tokens from Azure Identity provider for&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 1: Fail over from on-premises:&lt;/strong&gt; After setting up replication to Azure for on-premises machines, when your on-premises site goes down, you fail those machines over to Azure. After failover, Azure VMs are created from replicated data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 2: Reprotect Azure VMs:&lt;/strong&gt; In Azure, you reprotect the Azure VMs so that they start replicating back to the on-premises site. The on-premises VM (if available) is turned off during reprotection, to help ensure data consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 3: Fail over from Azure:&lt;/strong&gt; When your on-premises site is running as normal again, you run another failover, this time to fail back Azure VMs to your on-premises site. You can fail back to the original location from which you failed over, or to an alternate location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 4: Reprotect on-premises machines:&lt;/strong&gt; After failing back, again enable replication of the on-premises machines to Azure.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Securing your workload and datacenter over the cloud is very challenging. You want your resources to be protected by both machines and users. Azure Active directory helps you to achieve single sign on and provides you centralize identity and access management across your subscriptions. Let’s learn more basic concepts about Azure Active Directory in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft provides Azure AD for developers and Microsoft Identity platform to help both programmatic and operational support for single-sign on, Identity and access management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-azure-active-directory-ad&quot;&gt;What is Azure Active Directory (AD)?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/what-is-application-management&quot;&gt;Microsoft Azure AD&lt;/a&gt; is an Identity and Access Management (IAM) system for the Microsoft cloud. A centralized identity system provides a single place to store user information that can then be used by all applications. These systems have come to be known as Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems. Azure AD performs the authentication using the tenant directory stored in the cloud. Making Azure AD aware of these apps, and how it should handle them, is known as application management. You manage applications on the Enterprise applications page located in the Manage section of the Azure Active Directory portal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-azure-ad-work-with-apps&quot;&gt;How does Azure AD work with apps?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure AD sits in the middle and provides &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/what-is-application-management&quot;&gt;identity management&lt;/a&gt; for cloud and on-premises apps. You can integrate on-premises apps using App Proxy.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3w439fV.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-an-azure-account&quot;&gt;What is an Azure account?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create or work with an Azure subscription, you must have an Azure account. An Azure account is simply an identity in Azure Active directory (Azure AD).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-take-microsoft-azure-subscription&quot;&gt;How to take Microsoft Azure Subscription?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to create an Azure subscription &amp;amp; I do not have an Azure Account. THen if I have account in below directories then I am okay I can create subscriptions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Personal Microsoft Account&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;School Organization&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work Organization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can create subscriptions in AZure using any account from the above-3 directories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;can-azure-active-directory-work-with-other-organizations&quot;&gt;Can Azure Active Directory work with Other Organizations?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create or work with an Azure subscription, you must have an Azure account. An Azure account is simply an identity in Azure AD or in a directory, such as a work or school organization, that Azure AD trusts. If you don’t belong to such an organization, you can always create a subscription by using your Microsoft Account, which is trusted by Azure AD. 
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/dkAgahS.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;relationship-between-azure-subscription--azure-active-directory&quot;&gt;Relationship between Azure Subscription &amp;amp; Azure Active Directory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every Azure subscription has a trust relationship with an Azure AD instance. This means that it trusts that directory to authenticate users, services, and devices. Multiple subscriptions can trust the same directory, but a subscription trusts only one directory.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/K6yDuoy.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RgpiTHu.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-groups-inside-active-directory&quot;&gt;Creating Groups inside Active Directory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as defining individual Azure account identities, also called users, you can define groups in Azure AD. Creating user groups is a good way to manage access to resources in a subscription by using role-based access control (RBAC).
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Kfr6k69.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;azure-ad-subscription-and-resource-group-relationship&quot;&gt;Azure AD Subscription and Resource Group Relationship&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically every subscription trust on azure active directory. The users and groups within directory can be assigned role based access control (RBAC) to access resources like storage, compute, network, database and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BzP0hcx.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-azure-ad-tenant&quot;&gt;What is Azure AD Tenant?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tenant represents an organization. A tenant is used by an organization. Example: the tenant used by the Adatum organization who developed HR application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure AD gets created automatically when you create a Microsoft account from Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Intune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WajqfHv.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;azure-ad-environments&quot;&gt;Azure AD Environments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dedicated instance of Azure AD is called “Azure AD Tenant”. You can create a maximum of 20 Azure AD Tenants per Azure subscription. Each Azure AD Tenant is separate from others. Azure AD Tenant has its users or consumes identities. Azure AD Tenant can have resources and they  are secured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the users your application is authenticating you can create 2 types of environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work and school or Personal ( outlook.com, live.com )&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Social  &amp;amp; local (Azure AD B2C )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All storage come with overall features and capabilities that Azure Storage provides like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared Access Signatures&lt;/strong&gt;: provides temporary access to some operations on storage type like Blob storage. This is useful for implementing the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;valet key&lt;/code&gt; pattern.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Firewalls&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Virtual Network&lt;/code&gt; using this you can increase security to your Azure storage data.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Data encryption&lt;/code&gt; at rest. Azure storage will encrypt and decrypt the data for you out of the box.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Storage replication
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Locally-redundant&lt;/strong&gt; : 3 copies of the data stored in the local data-center&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geo-redundant&lt;/strong&gt;: In addition to Locally-redundant, it will store 3 copies of data in the other geographical data-center&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read-access-geo-redundant&lt;/strong&gt;: You can also create readable Geo-redundant also.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Are you planning to migrate your on-premise data to the cloud using Azure data transfer solutions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a high level there are only 2 solutions to transfer your on-premise data to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Offline Data Transfer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Online Data Transfer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;offline-data-transfer&quot;&gt;Offline data transfer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud providers will ship you a secure specialized device or disk based on the volume of data. You copy data to that device, apply a secret pin and then send it back to Azure where the data is uploaded and you can verify your Azure Storage account for the uploaded data. Sometimes if data is not that big then you can purchase a disk of your own and ship it to azure. Azure has a Databox family to help you transfer your data offline.  Data Box Disk, Data Box, Data Box Heavy, and import/export (use your own disk).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data box is normally 8-TB BitLocker-encrypted SSD upto 35 TB capacity. If you need more data then you order more of them. Yes you can put 2 or 3 disks of 35TB each and copy parallels data on them using SMB protocol and tools like Robocopy. The disk will have predefined folders like PageBlob, BlockBlob, AzureFile, or ManagedDisk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;File/Folder restrictions while copying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blob blocks file size must not exceed 4.75 tebibytes (1 TiB = 240 bytes )&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Page blocks file size must not exceed 8 tebibytes (TiB)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Azure Files file size must not exceed 1 tebibytes (TiB)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Subfolder names should be lowercase, from 3 to 63 characters, and consist only of letters, numbers, and hyphens. Consecutive hyphens aren’t allowed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;File names for Azure Files shouldn’t exceed 255 characters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What to copy where?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ManagedDisk folder for VHD (Virtual Hard Disk) files.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PageBlob folder to save VHDX (successor of Virtual Hard Disk) files.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;BlockBlob folder to save images, documents etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;AzureFile folder to save folder and files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only bad part of this option is it takes time to do this way of data transfer. You have to create an order, wait around 10 days for the device to come, copy, ship it back to Azure, then upload data and finally erase the data as per the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/T28XMm5nJkyajL7-9MuUjDB7XejV9EglIxvcphhcwRmD2EVF5pzenuybNnfzB7HzTKv8aeJsTEDbRpmMwjlktCcTvhE8UAfj00R2Ya94IJNOZ-E-b3T7bU5EMtlWEttrxYNqw_NJ=s0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: For Data Box Heavy, make sure that it will fit through the entrance of your premises, and that you have at least two people to handle it. It’s a massive device that weighs around 500 lbs and arrives on wheels 😃&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;online-data-transfer&quot;&gt;Online data transfer &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You use your internet bandwidth to securely transfer data to azure cloud over the network. You can use Azure Applications to transfer data like Azure Storage Explorer or Azure web portal. You can even write your own powershell or node.js .net java etc. script to transfer data. You can use the Azure data factory to create a pipeline to set up dedicated data transfer. Finally if you have some analytics to be done before  you send data over cloud like filter PII data or any other custom filter, logic and want to optimise transfer by cache frequent data etc. then use Azure Stack Edge. You need a physical device, the Azure Stack Edge and virtual device the Data Box Gateway. Azure ships you Azure Stack Edge device, you install it on-premise permanently and connect to Azure over your network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/f0erDWSp3rKqmhxokCTuDVageaobRC4ZRaCAKq2YHoDO2dRoZShLGocRjMTl4haB8e5bGO4rZX18Klgvn4RviYqn9BgPNOu4ddgbmXNK2GyGFT9a7D3oEKHbhxHeFnPXEDX0QHDF=s0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-decide-which-data-transfer-solution-to-select&quot;&gt;How to decide which data transfer solution to select?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should answer below 3 questions to help yourself to decide which solution is good for your data transfer to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the size/volume of the data?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How much network bandwidth is available in my on-premise environment?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How often do I want to transfer data, is it one-time or continuous data transfer?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;general-cloud-data-transfer-scenarios&quot;&gt;General Cloud Data Transfer Scenarios &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s discuss major scenarios of data transfer to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you want to transfer a large volume of data with low network bandwidth or is it expensive?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you want to transfer a large volume of data with moderate to high network bandwidth?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you want to transfer a small volume of data with moderate network bandwidth?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you want to transfer a point-in-time data transfer at regular intervals?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you want to transfer an on-going data transfer at regular intervals?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-transfer-for-large-datasets-with-low-or-no-network-bandwidth&quot;&gt;Data transfer for large datasets with low or no network bandwidth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large amounts of data means few TBs or PBs of data you may not want to send over wire because of low internet speed (100 Mbps - 1 Gbps)  or security policy which does not allow you to transfer data over wire. In this scenario, I prefer a physical device to do a one-time bulk data transfer. Choose from Data Box Disk, Data Box, Data Box Heavy devices which are supplied by Microsoft, or Import/Export using your own disks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are still confused should you use physical device or not then use below table to decide&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DF7h0tCmu6MXxgjnPbwH_Yl89dcvQA9NPehjKzbk_1TS-eUkwMwfeJyh75wcXjVALZlDq7uBmIqA21bFXci3jZ3ZdUEBuM6CkgMU-lN_D96-3WH6yQEIaz75Azz_88LA_zEJJCtD=s0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-transfer-for-large-datasets-with-high-network-bandwidth&quot;&gt;Data transfer for large datasets with high network bandwidth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have high network bandwidth (1 Gbps - 50 Gbps) and you rely on cloud security setup then prefer data transfer via network bandwidth only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Powershell AzCopy CLI is a good choice to spin-up parallel processes to transfer data over the network to the Azure cloud. It will resume transferring if the data transfer is interrupted. However, it needs technical knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rest API exposed by Azure Storage is also a good choice if you have your development team to create UI for you to transfer data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure Data Box family for online transfer: If you want to do live streaming of data to the cloud and also you want to pre-process your data then prefer using Azure Data Box Edge physical device with Data Box Gateway virtual device together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure Data Factory:  Use Data Factory to regularly transfer files between several Azure services, on-premises, or a combination of the two. with Data Factory, you can create and schedule data-driven workflows (called pipelines) that ingest data from disparate data stores and automate data movement and data transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-solution-large-dataset-moderate-high-network&quot;&gt;Refer this article&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about comparisons on which tool you use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-transfer-for-small-datasets-with-low-to-moderate-network-bandwidth&quot;&gt;Data transfer for small datasets with low to moderate network bandwidth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have network speed around ( 50 Mbps - 1 Gbps ) and data is low then go for an online data transfer solution that I described in the above scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;solutions-for-periodic-data-transfer&quot;&gt;Solutions for periodic data transfer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to transfer data at specific calendar time frequently like point-in-time once in a week/month then based on your internet speed, policies and data size you can choose either offline or online data transfer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to transfer data from on-premise to cloud on a regular basis like every day or continuous transfer then prefer online data transfer option only. You can use&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Object replication - In Azure you can use object replication to sync containers between multiple azure storage accounts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Azure data factory - You can orchestrate data-driven workflows that can combine both on-prem and azure data and provide automatic data transmission to the cloud.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Also try Azure Data Box Family for online transfer - this option is for excellent performance and data filtering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;references&quot;&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Moderate Network Bandwidth is 100 Mbps - 1 Gbps&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;High Network Bandwidth is 1 Gbps - 50 Gbps&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 GB = 109 Bytes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 TB = 1012 Bytes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 PB (Petabyte) = 1015 Bytes&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Virtualization is the single concept that now-a-days cloud service providers are using at massive scale and delivering IT technologies such as storage, compute, networking, database, analysis and much more as a service via internet and on-demand basis as pay-as-you-go pricing model. Therefore, it is very important that you must understand what is virtualization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-virtualization&quot;&gt;What is Virtualization&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtualization is a technology that lets you create a logical boundary around physical hardware and capabilities such as compute, storage and network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose you got one bare machine that has 64 GB RAM, 2 TB storage and 32 Core CPU. Then using hypervisor or virtualization techniques you can create 10 virtual machines on this hypervisor each having 4 GB RAM, 100GB disk storage and 2 Core CPU. Each Virtual Machine is a literal isolated machine, they can not talk to each other unless you provision so it gives data center level infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yClGm4N.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-host&quot;&gt;What is a Host?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Host is a hardware where a hypervisor is installed. Guest is a virtual machine created on a hypervisor. Virtual Machine operating systems are also called Guest Operating Systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-hypervisor&quot;&gt;What is a Hypervisor?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypervisor is a software or firmware that creates and runs virtual machines. A hypervisor is also called as Virtual Machine Manager (VMM)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fSWfhNW.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 2 types of hypervisor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Type-1&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Type-2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/581Jh8v.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-are-the-attributes-of-type-1-hypervisor&quot;&gt;What are the attributes of Type-1 Hypervisor?  &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They come with bare metal machine on top of we install hypervisor firmware&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Type-1 Hypervisor is used for enterprise data center&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;VMWare has ESXi software for hypervisor&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Microsoft has Hyper-V&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Citrix has Xenserver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NugWBgI.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-are-the-attributes-of-type-2-hypervisor&quot;&gt;What are the attributes of Type-2 Hypervisor?  &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;These types of hypervisors are softwares that you install on top of the Operating System of a computer. They are hosted hypervisors.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Type-2 Hypervisor is used for Testing, Learning purpose&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;VMWare has Workstation software for hypervisor&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Microsoft has Virtual PC&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Oracle has Virtual Box&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kUsDd8n.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-vmware-vsphere&quot;&gt;What is VMWare VSphere?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VMWare is an American cloud computing &amp;amp; virtualization company. Vsphere is the brand name of vmware suite of virtualization products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VSphere has got:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vmware ESXi (Hypervisor)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vcenter Server&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vsphere client&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vsphere web client&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vsphere-client&quot;&gt;Vsphere Client&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VSphere client is an User Interface to access &amp;amp; configure ESXi Host.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/lGU4gRX.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vcenter-server&quot;&gt;Vcenter Server&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VCenter Server provides features like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Distributed Resource scheduler (DRS)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;High Availability (HA)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;VMotion ( replication technique )&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fault Tolerance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;VM Migrations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3pQBmuQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-data-store-in-vmware-hypervisor&quot;&gt;What is a data store in VMWare Hypervisor? &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All files related to a virtual machine like log file, virtual disk file, iso files, configuration files are stored in the Data Store only. It can have 2 types of filesystems like Virtual Machine File System (VMFS) and NFS (Network File System).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/w0lx1WD.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-migration-and-their-types&quot;&gt;What is Migration and their types?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Migration is the technique of moving a virtual machine from one host to another host or from one data store to another data store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;5 Migration&lt;/code&gt; strategies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cold Migration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Suspended Migration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;VMotion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;P2V (Physical to Virtual)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;V2V (Virtual to Virtual)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;From Microsoft hyper-v to vmware&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;From vmware to xenserver etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-the-states-of-a-virtual-machine&quot;&gt;What are the states of a virtual machine?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hot&lt;/strong&gt; State means virtual machine is &lt;strong&gt;ON&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cold&lt;/strong&gt; State means virtual machine is &lt;strong&gt;OFF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suspended&lt;/strong&gt; State means virtual machine is &lt;strong&gt;ON&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;PAUSED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-cold-migration-technique&quot;&gt;What is Cold Migration Technique?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the cold migration technique we transfer a VM while it is Cold State to another host. If 2 data centers are in the same Vcenter server instance then only cold migration is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-suspended-migration-technique&quot;&gt;What is Suspended Migration Technique?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you migrate your virtual machine (VM) in suspended state. Here power is on and running so it is a HOT migration category. Suspended state means your vm is in paused state and you resume from the same point at a later time. This migration is used to troubleshoot your virtual machine technical issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-vmotion&quot;&gt;What is vMotion?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;vMotion is a live migration technique where you migrate your virtual machine at power on state or Hot State.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 types of vMotion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Host level: Where VM is migrated to another ESXi host&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data Store: Where VM is migrated from one datastore to another datastore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-physical-to-virtual-p2v-migration&quot;&gt;What is Physical to Virtual P2V Migration?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P2V migration converts a physical computer to a virtual machine. You run vmware vcenter converter and copy the physical server to VM in ESXi host.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Microsoft Azure you use Azure Migration Service and agents to migrate your physical machine to the Azure cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In AWS you also use a migration service to migrate your physical machine to AWS cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-physical-to-virtual-v2v-migration&quot;&gt;What is Physical to Virtual V2V Migration?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;V2V migration is like P2V except the source machine is already a virtual machine. Different company Virtual machine migrated to another new company. Like Hyper-V migrated to ESXi and Xenserver migrated to Hyper-V.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Azure gives this facility to migrate Hyper-V or ESXi migration to the cloud. Most of the cloud service providers are giving this opportunity nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-fault-tolerance-ft-how-ft-works-what-are-ft-benefits&quot;&gt;What is Fault Tolerance (FT), How FT works, What are FT benefits?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fault Tolerance is a Virtual Machine level concept where you protect your Virtual Machine from stop working. Suppose some operating system level corruption happened and your virtual machine is not working so you want to protect your VM from that and you create a redundant VM to make it more fault tolerant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In VMWare you can enable/disable FT at VM level. FT makes system high availability give 0% downtime since VM will always be in running mode &amp;amp; no restart required in case of VM crash. Because you keep the VM in backup as a redundant VM. so billing will be for 2 VMs this is a costly solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FT must be used for Mission critical applications and servers like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Auto Pilot system&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spacecraft mission&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The secondary VM is created by DRS ( Distributed Resource Scheduler ) in a different HOST than the primary VM host. VMware &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockstep_(computing)&quot;&gt;lockstep technolog&lt;/a&gt;y is used in FT where current state &amp;amp; events on primary VM is replicated on secondary VM. When primary goes down the secondary VM takes over and continues operating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6j97d3H.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xDIjbIO.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FT avoids &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-brain&quot;&gt;Split Brain&lt;/a&gt; situation when primary fails then if 2 secondary VMs created and works is a problem called split brain. Primary and secondary continuously check each other’s heart-beat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Azure cloud you get Fault Domain where if you have more than 1 Virtual Machine then Azure will put your VM in 2 different fault domains therefore, if one VM is out of order then another VM will automatically start responding. This gives you any kind of hardware protection such as network or power on rack etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Microsoft Azure cloud you also have a virtual machine scale set that gives you managed service internal it composed of load balancer, and more than 1 virtual machine. You can put them in different fault domains and update domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Amazon AWS you get an availability group that is this same as the Azure availability set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-high-availability&quot;&gt;What is High Availability?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want your Virtual Machine to keep running regardless of the situation occurring in your data center. If you bought a 3rd party service like fastcomet or any other provider then it’s their responsibility to take care of High Availability (HA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore companies create Service Level Agreement (SLA) with customers to provide guaranteed service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Level of Agreement&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Down Time Per Hours&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;99%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;87 hours&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;99.9%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;8.76 hours&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;99.99%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;52 mins&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;99.999%&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;5 mins&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If SLA is not achieved then the company will give you compensation as per the level of agreement. Like Microsoft Azure will credit the money back to your monthly bill if they are not able to meet SLA.  Similarly Amazon AWS also will compensate if they could not meet committed SLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-high-availability-ha-works-in-vmware&quot;&gt;How High Availability (HA) works in VMWare? &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your hardware or ESXi host has any issues then all VMs will become down. It is just like your entire data center is down. HA works on HOST level and Fault Tolerance (FT) works on VM level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you create a backup virtual machine then it is a very costly solution. In the past VM backup  used to be the only solution therefore, companies used to avoid going on virtualization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in VMWare High Availability meaning, if the host crashes or fails then all the VMs on that host get restarted from another new host and hence you get business continuity and high availability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HA is an automated process that does not need any admin/human interference. In HA you do not need any standby ESXi hosts or extra VMs as redundant. It can restart VM on any runnin ghosts. HA doesn ot use VMotion and can be enabled on cluster settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HOFLW0n.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For HA you need below things in your VMWare&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cluster&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shared Storage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;VCenter Server configured for the environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prerequisites-for-vmware-vsphere-ha&quot;&gt;Prerequisites for VMWare Vsphere HA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All hosts must be licensed and the same version. You need a minimum of 2 hosts. All hosts must have a static IP address after restart of VM IP should persist. VM must be located in shared data storage and they should not have their own local data storage. All hosts in VMware HA Cluster must have DNS configured. HA works on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary/replica_architecture&quot;&gt;Master and Slave Architecture.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zKqBVY0.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-vmware-high-availability-ha-cluster&quot;&gt;What is VMWare High Availability (HA) Cluster?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When HA is enabled on the cluster then the election process occurs among all hosts. One host that has a maximum number of data stores mounted becomes master  &amp;amp; rest become slaves.If Master host is down then again election will start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/luhBFUQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-resource-check-in-vmware-ha&quot;&gt;What is a Resource check in VMware HA? &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resource check is a feature of HA which ensures that capacity is available to restart VMs in a crash scenario. Also it reserves some capacity that you can not use when HA is enabled. Suppose you have 64 GB ram and you have 5 VMs each 4 GB ram then it may reserve extra 20 GB ram for crash scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-ha-failover-time&quot;&gt;What is HA Failover Time?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
HA Failover time = Vsphere web client started responding time - Vcenter server VM stopped responding time. 

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;64&lt;/code&gt; hosts and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;6000&lt;/code&gt; VMs will take approximately &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;7 minutes&lt;/code&gt; to failover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9HFdcT3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-virtual-machine-template-in-vmware&quot;&gt;What is Virtual Machine Template in VMWare?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Convert fully configured custom personalized VM into VM Template. Use a VM template to deploy a large number of the same VMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays every cloud service provider including (Azure, AWS) supports VM templates in various forms.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/1062879/worldwide-cloud-storage-of-corporate-data/#:~:text=As%20of%202021%2C%20around%2050,next%20to%20advancing%20business%20agility&quot;&gt;Statista.com&lt;/a&gt; As of 2021, around 50 percent of all corporate data is stored in the cloud. This share reached 30 percent in 2015 and has continued to grow as companies increasingly shift their resources into cloud environments in the hope of improving security and reliability next to advancing business agility. Therefore, securing your data center, your deployed workloads and your architecture in the cloud is now-a-days top priority for every company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the Cloud providers like Amazon AWS &amp;amp; Microsoft Azure follow the shared security model where they take care of security of the cloud and you secure what is in the cloud. Therefore, you must educate yourself to start securing your workload and architecture in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You start securing your environment from network to server to application &amp;amp; data layers. Let’s discuss all of these best practices in detail in this article. For cloud protection, I will refer to Azure cloud in this article. You can correlate &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/aws-professional/services&quot;&gt;Azure Services &amp;amp; Infrastructures with AWS cloud&lt;/a&gt; by referring to this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;application-security&quot;&gt;Application Security&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is application security important in your on-premise or cloud? Did you know 75% of organizations worldwide have experienced some kind of phishing attack in 2021? Have you heard about a multi-layered approach to security? Cybercriminals know that web applications are the key to enter an organization’s technology enterprise and steal valuable information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can secure your web applications in the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Single Sign-On&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Application Integrity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vulnerability Scanning and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Virtual Patching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;single-sign-on-in-the-cloud&quot;&gt;Single Sign-On in the cloud&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have your on-premise or cloud line of business (LOB) applications, and you want to secure them. Single Sign-On (SSO) is one of the crucial steps to securing your applications. You may ask what Single Sign-On will do in terms of security, right? I used to think SSO is something where you enter a password or login to your enterprise network once, and then you don’t need to log in for other applications. Then what exactly is it saving for security? Well, it can protect you from phishing attacks, for one. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.tessian.com/blog/phishing-statistics-2020/&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1633966929713000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0rPv3CiTK4qpNOEfoxv_3d&quot;&gt;Tessian Phishing Statistics 2020&lt;/a&gt;, last year, 75% of organizations worldwide faced a phishing attack. Azure integrates your web applications with Azure active directory and provides single sign-on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/UOsaf4h.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phishing attacks are emails that will ask you to log in to your application using your password. Examples of phishing emails include: Please Read subject or Payment is Urgent Credential needed for login to secure etc. Suppose you were using SSO and strong authentication in your organization, eliminating the need for employees to ever manually enter passwords to access systems, applications, or information. An email requesting credentials would stand out as a likely phishing attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;application-integrity-check&quot;&gt;Application Integrity Check&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, the number of data breaches in the United &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/273550/data-breaches-recorded-in-the-united-states-by-number-of-breaches-and-records-exposed/&quot;&gt;States came in at a total of 1001 cases.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, as an organization, you want to make sure your application data integrity is conserved. Application Integrity helps clients secure their organizations. There are many best practices and rules available in Azure policy that require compliance from your applications. Basic requirements like using Https for web APIs and certification validation for calling endpoints are very effective. Limiting access to your applications for only those clients that have a valid certificate will limit your exposure. By default, incoming client certificates are disabled for Azure App Service web applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure has managed initiatives (collection of policies) for compliance domain and security control. Make sure you apply one of them to your app service plan and other resources in your workload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vulnerability-scans-in-applications&quot;&gt;Vulnerability Scans in Applications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://info.edgescan.com/vulnerability-stats-report-2021&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1633966929715000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1-PJ5lIm1vsmfu9HDYW-8j&quot;&gt;Edgescan’s 2021 Vulnerability Statistics Report&lt;/a&gt; analyzed the severity of web application vulnerabilities. It found that 50 percent of internal application vulnerabilities are considered a high or critical risk. It also found that 32 percent of vulnerabilities in internet-facing applications are considered a high or critical risk. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.k2io.com/2021-verizon-data-breach-investigations-report-is-out/&quot;&gt;the Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report&lt;/a&gt; web applications remain the top vector used by hacking in breaches at over 90%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WbwSU43.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, you must scan your web app for vulnerability risk. Azure Web apps provide built-in tools for diagnoses and solving vulnerability problems. Azure App Service Diagnostics will help identify and alert you to the security risks associated with your web application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/lqGz7hu.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;virtual-patching-for-legacy-code&quot;&gt;Virtual Patching for Legacy Code&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtual Patches are meant for protecting unitary vulnerabilities that the current WAF Security Policy does not already protect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cybercriminals know web apps connect with backend, active directory to get valuable business and intellectual data. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach&quot;&gt;According to IBM data breach report 2021&lt;/a&gt;, data breach costs rose from USD 3.86 million to USD 4.24 million, a 17-year historic increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the large volume of cloud migration and web application development, many organizations create too many web apps with too many vulnerabilities. They are left exposed to potential data breaches through these applications. Some companies even take their windows applications and convert them into web applications without understanding how to secure them. Additionally, many applications are poorly written and have security loopholes. So how does an organization mitigate the risk of a breach through their web app portfolio?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use Microsoft’s PaaS (platform service) and leverage Azure vulnerability scans and patching services. Frequent scanning and patching ensure your protection is up-to-date and continuous. Need secure zero-day vulnerability on your web app? Review your case with Azure and get protection for your dedicated host.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, I recommend you follow a &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/?wa-lens-whitepapers.sort-by=item.additionalFields.sortDate&amp;amp;wa-lens-whitepapers.sort-order=desc&quot;&gt;Well-Architected Framework&lt;/a&gt; for security for web applications. Do code reviews and seek out any security violations in your code and remove them - similar to sanitizing your incoming text from client to server to make sure you avoid running scripts injected by malicious users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about vulnerabilities in existing and potentially out-of-date applications? What if you have VMs hosting web apps in the cloud and you own the responsibility of patching servers? If you leave your VMs vulnerable, they will be the first choice for attackers. The answer is Virtual Patching. Virtual Patching is the technique leveraging WAS (web application scan) and WAF (Web application firewall) to install virtual patch software; use WAS to identify vulnerabilities, and then automatically create rules in &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/web-application-firewall/afds/afds-overview&quot;&gt;WAF (Web Application Firewall)&lt;/a&gt;. This way, you end up protecting your app from existing vulnerabilities attacks without changing your source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;network-security-in-cloud&quot;&gt;Network Security in Cloud&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cloud you can secure your network by doing the following things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Network segmentation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Network Session Protection&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Network Monitoring&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Traffic Encryption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network Segmentation&lt;/strong&gt; inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_security_model&quot;&gt;Zero Trust Model&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Network Segmentation can help control your company’s network traffic flow. Your IT team can regulate who has access to which segment of the network. Segmentation improves security and performance by dividing the entire network into parts. For example, as a bank, you want to restrict branch employees from your financial reporting systems. With Network segmentation, you can limit traffic flow in the financial system segment, improving performance for the financial analysts and limiting unnecessary system access from unauthorized systems and users. Additionally, you may limit the scope of an infection or attack to a single segment rather than the entire network. Finally, Network Segmentation is a crucial element of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_security_model&quot;&gt;Zero Trust model&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://securityscorecard.com/blog/network-segmentation-best-practices-to-maximize-cybersecurity&quot;&gt;best practices of segmentation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On-premises you can use a legacy approach to create multiple DMZ (demilitarized zones) using internal firewalls and Access control Lists( ACLs); however, this approach is more costly and time-consuming. Nowadays, you can apply tags on selected routes and group them virtually by tagging. A tag will enforce segmentation policy directly on the network equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Azure cloud, you can achieve network segmentation as well by properly organizing network infrastructures. You have an azure subscription, virtual network, network security group, application security group, and an azure firewall. These are great tools to create micro perimeters or segments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Azure cloud, you can use subnets within a single virtual network and apply custom routes on each subnet to restrict traffic flow. Alternatively, you can use an application gateway to each subnet. However, this pattern where all workload is in one virtual network cannot span multiple regions since the scope of a virtual network is limited to only one region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you use a virtual network (VNet), you get built-in segmentation because one VNet or VPC by default can not talk to others unless you set up peering. You can set up rules like, for example, virtual network X can’t talk with virtual network Y but can talk with virtual network Z, or no Internet for Virtual network X except for access to &lt;em&gt;.github.com&lt;/em&gt;, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use multiple Virtual networks and use virtual network peering to get segmentation free and use NSG or ASG to enforce policies. However, Virtual network peering is not transitive by nature so consider &lt;strong&gt;transitive gateway&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Hub &amp;amp; Spoke&lt;/strong&gt; model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/dPSq0qG.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fix transitive issues, I would recommend going to a Hub and Spoke topology where you create one dedicated VNet as your hub network and all traffic passes through the virtual hub network, and it can act as a gateway to other hubs in different regions. You can set up your security posture at the hubs, so they get to segment and govern the traffic between the virtual networks in a scalable way. Adding a new workload or new virtual network with the same security posture is a minimal effort. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/network-level-segmentation&quot;&gt;Learn more about network segmentation in azure here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;session-protection&quot;&gt;Session Protection&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your users might log in to the system to establish a session with the server and forget to close the browser, creating &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.globalsign.com/en/blog/session-hijacking-and-how-to-prevent-it&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1633966929727000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2rIMES5rLflGwVo0CM3CFM&quot;&gt;Session Hijacking&lt;/a&gt; opportunities. Any cybercriminal can take advantage of the open sessions and steal valuable information. According to the 2021 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalsign.com/en/blog/session-hijacking-and-how-to-prevent-it&quot;&gt;Vulnerability Statistics Report&lt;/a&gt;, 37% of XSS attacks targeted web applications. Those attacks could be prevented by Network session protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/W7Ifi3s.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;types-of-session-hijacking-attacks&quot;&gt;Types of Session Hijacking Attacks:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): attackers exploit vulnerabilities within servers and inject scripts (JS, Active Directory, DOS) via web pages and retrieve information.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Session-Side Jacking: attackers can sniff through network packets to get the session key via session cookies and impersonate them to perform malicious actions. These attacks are even more likely when employees access company assets via public WIFI or an unsecured hotspot.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Session Fixation: Attackers supply their session key and spoof the user into accessing a vulnerable server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can protect your network by using a web application firewall to protect any session established on your network from the outside world. Also, if you apply initiatives and policies to your resource groups, you will be forced to implement certification-based communication. That way, you verify the outside endpoints connecting to your server and mitigate session attacks. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-ssl-bindings#add-a-certificate-for-custom-domain&quot;&gt;In the Azure web app, you can also apply for SSL certificates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mt7RsG1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;network-monitoring&quot;&gt;Network Monitoring&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Network security monitoring is helpful for detecting and analyzing potential threats. Network cybersecurity monitoring can help protect your enterprise data from malicious actors and hackers, from business stats to personal user information. In your on-premises solution, you can use the NMap tool to scan the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hCZwCBu.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/insights/network-insights-overview&quot;&gt;Azure cloud Network Insights&lt;/a&gt; within the Azure Security Center can comprehensively view health and metrics for all deployed network resources. You can also see dependency flow, connectivity, and traffic flow, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;network-traffic-encryption&quot;&gt;Network Traffic Encryption&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encrypting your data while it’s in transit is an essential step toward securing your applications. You can purchase certificates from a certificate authority and use them to encrypt the messages that pass in and out of your servers. Encryption prevents unauthorized users from intercepting and examining the information in these messages while in transit. Encryption also prevents &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack&quot;&gt;Man in the Middle Attacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use Application Gateway or front door in Azure or the Web Application Firewall of AWS to protect your traffic and ensure they are encrypted. If you need end-to-end encryption, Application Gateway can use your private key to decrypt the traffic on the gateway and re-encrypt using the public key of the service running in the backend pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exposing your website or web application through Application Gateway means you don’t directly connect your servers to the web. You’re exposing only port 80 or port 443 on the application gateway. Your web servers aren’t directly accessible from the internet, reducing the attack surface of your infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/uTwY2Zx.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Application Gateway can implement an SSL connection with clients. Application Gateway can also implement an SSL connection with the servers running your application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;serverhost-security-in-cloud&quot;&gt;Server/Host Security in cloud&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the cloud, you have to secure your virtual machines on your own. Cloud providers will take care of the cloud, but you have to take care of whatever is in the cloud, especially virtual machines. When you provision virtual machines, you are responsible for patching and installing anti-virus and otherwise caring for security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure Security center can scan the network and, based on security policy, alert you to any pending patches, including cloud and on-premise malware vulnerabilities found. Of course, you still have to take corrective actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please consider below best practices to secure your EC2 instances or Virtual Machines in cloud:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Installing Anti Malware &amp;amp; Antivirus, you can purchase them from Microsoft or Symantec, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Secure your encryption keys created in VMs in the Azure Key Vault or AWS key management service (KMS) in AWS cloud.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Protect your server by running frequent backups - try &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-overview&quot;&gt;Azure Backup&lt;/a&gt; which does not need any CaPeX to set up and provides complete protection of your application data.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Protect from unplanned outages by implementing Site Recovery to ensure your organization’s business continuity and disaster recovery objectives keeping your applications and servers running. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-overview&quot;&gt;Azure Site Recovery&lt;/a&gt; helps to protect both on-premise and cloud workloads from disasters.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secure SQL data using Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) and column level encryption (CLE).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Encrypt Virtual Machine disks - to encrypt your VMs disks try &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/azure-disk-encryption-vms-vmss&quot;&gt;Azure Disk Encryption&lt;/a&gt; solution.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consistently and frequently run Patch updates.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prevent unauthorized access on your VMs by implementing SSO (Single Sign On) and using identity-based access controls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in this article we learned that your cloud service provider will take care of the security of the cloud. However, You are responsible for securing workloads in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to secure your workload in the cloud you must follow both Defense in depth and Zero Trust Model. The objective of Defense in Depth is to protect information and prevent it from being stolen by those who aren’t authorized to access it. Zero Trust is a strategic initiative that helps prevent successful data breaches by eliminating the concept of trust from an organization’s network architecture. You trust nobody in your network, create a micro perimeter. This will help to Bring Your Device (BYOD) related security risk.&lt;/p&gt;

Therefore, securing your data center, your deployed workloads and your architecture in the cloud is now-a-days top priority for every company.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/nU9cLAy.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/nU9cLAy.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Azure Network Watcher Basics</title><link href="https://www.rupeshtiwari.com/azure-network-watcher-basics/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Azure Network Watcher Basics" /><published>2021-11-20T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-11-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.rupeshtiwari.com/azure-network-watcher-basics</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.rupeshtiwari.com/azure-network-watcher-basics/">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Azure Network Watcher is a &lt;strong&gt;monitoring service&lt;/strong&gt; with lots of other important services for network. &lt;strong&gt;Most network diagnostics issues can be detected and analyzed with Azure Network Watcher&lt;/strong&gt;. Learn everything about Network Watcher in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-network-watcher-does&quot;&gt;What Network Watcher Does?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/H2mtWg4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You use Network Watcher to monitor and repair the network health of IaaS (Infrastructure as Service) resources.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can capture network packets by sniffing the network&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can analyze and display the network topology&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can audit the security rules of network and VMs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is a regional service&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is automatically enabled in a region when you create or update a virtual network (vNet) in it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;capabilities-of-network-watcher&quot;&gt;Capabilities of Network Watcher&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;monitoring&quot;&gt;Monitoring&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Network Watcher can monitor communication between a VM and another endpoint (could be VM).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Network Watcher can view resources in a virtual network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;diagnostics&quot;&gt;Diagnostics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can diagnose network traffic filtering problems to or from a VM.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can diagnose network routing problems from a VM.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can diagnose outbound connections from a VM.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can capture packets to and from VM.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can determine relative latencies between Azure regions and Internet Service Providers (ISPs).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can show security rules for an interface like network interface for a VM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;metrics-and-logs&quot;&gt;Metrics and Logs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can analyze network security groups traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can show diagnostics logs for network resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;network-watcher-in-azure-portal&quot;&gt;Network Watcher in Azure Portal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;topology&quot;&gt;Topology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/aMuidSb.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;
You can monitor the topology of your virtual network and you can click on any component to view them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;connection-monitor&quot;&gt;Connection Monitor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/1XfzXrM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;
Connection Monitor monitors the health of the connections between 2 endpoints could be 2 virtual networks or 2 VMs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;next-hop&quot;&gt;Next hop&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will give you the next network hop from a given source IP address to a destination IP address. You can use this to troubleshoot the issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/dvmPfCr.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;
Example: Source IP address could be your VM in azure and destination IP address could be your local home machine IP address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/eYveirr.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;align-left&quot; /&gt;
So in this example the next hop is Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;effective-security-rules&quot;&gt;Effective Security Rules&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/vr6xfiR.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check security settings of your IaaS. Example: Check the security settings for your VM in Azure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;packet-capture&quot;&gt;Packet capture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/ChIOGIv.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investigate network by capturing the network packets. You can choose the Remote or local IP and port addresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--info&quot;&gt;👨‍🏫 In Exam remember: &lt;strong&gt;Most network diagnostics issues can be detected and analyzed with Azure Network Watcher&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Are you willing to become cloud solution architect? I am going to add a few important technical questions that you must know for your next cloud solution architect interview. My answers would not be perfect so feel free to search for better answers. Important part from this article is what kind of technical questions you should know to become a good cloud solution architect. So focus on the questions that I am asking here and learn from anywhere about their answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the time you will be asked various open-ended technical questions. The best strategy to answer them is think of below 4 things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is technology?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How does it work?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why would you use it?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do you architect them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must know what a software Architect does?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Business strategist&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Advisor&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;designer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have to speak the languages of CEO, CIO, CFO and Engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-amazon-ec2-elastic-compute-cloud-in-aws-or-virtual-machine-in-azure-cloud&quot;&gt;What is Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) in AWS or Virtual Machine in Azure cloud?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is virtualization of computers on cloud. Amazon EC2 is a virtualized machine where we can install applications and OS. It is an Infrastructure as a Service offering. We virtualize storage, network, CPU etc. using hypervisors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-caching-and-how-does-it-work&quot;&gt;What is caching and how does it work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caching is to offload servers by storing high frequently added information in the cache. If the user tries to take information from DB. It goes to cache and it will return. If the cache has no data it will go to the server return and cache it. Next person asks if it will return from the cache. It can improve performance, it can reduce latency. If you set up time to live of data in cache to timeout to keep it refreshing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-dns-and-what-are-the-key-record-types&quot;&gt;What is DNS? And what are the key record types?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domain name System used to map IP addresses to a user friendly name. Phonebook of the internet. You can route traffic Based on geography, latency , weight etc. Key Record Types are as following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A Record that match name to IPV4 address&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;AAAA Record that match name to IPV6 address&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CNAME record where u map one domain to another domain&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MX Record required for email.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-mitm-man-in-the-middle-attack&quot;&gt; What is the MiTM (Man in The Middle) attack?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A Man-In-The-Middle attack is the type of attack where attackers intrude into an existing connection to intercept the exchanged data and inject false information. It involves eavesdropping on a connection and intercepting messages.” -Toolbox for IT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/k2ofMxA.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hackers can use Packet sniffing software (WIRESHARK) to intrude the connection. Get the sender and receiver server information. He can get access to the website as Alice or Bob.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-encryption-at-rest-and-transit&quot;&gt;Data encryption at rest and transit?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At rest encrypt the disk and hence you get data encryption at rest out of the box. At transit use VPN or SSL/TLS (HTTPS = 443) to secure your data by hashing it during transit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-symmetric-and-asymmetric&quot;&gt;What is Symmetric and Asymmetric?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asymmetric: Sender data is encrypted with key1 and the receiver side uses key2 to decrypt the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symmetric: both sender and receiver use the same key to encrypt and decrypt data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-nmap&quot;&gt;What is NMap?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Used to scan a network, segment or host to find out the open ports. So that you can attack on those ports. Interviewer may ask if there is a linux machine and it has an application that is not working. What will you do. I will answer by saying I will first scan the network by using Nmap or wireshark to find out which ports are closed or opened etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-iam&quot;&gt;What is IAM?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users are defined in IAM and they get assigned with roles and they have access based on the role to the protected resources. Also it does logging of each activity done by the user.  Authentication &amp;amp; Authorization also done by IAM. Who is the user and what he is allowed to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-social-engineering&quot;&gt;What is Social Engineering?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social Engineer is someone who is a master of asking seemingly non-invasive&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or unimportant questions to gather information over time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gain trust&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reduce defenses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social Engineer use deception to get sensitive info from someone also s/he can combine number of techniques to gather sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-would-you-secure-enterprise&quot;&gt;How would you secure enterprise?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow Multi layer approach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Policy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Look from User , Encryption, IAM and Tech perspective&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create Firewall protect your network perimeter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;IDS and IPS system behind the firewall&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DDoS ( Aws shield, cloud flare )&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ACLS on the router and subnet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On the VM you install WAF to protect (XSS, XSRF)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Physical system secure ( like MAC address stop unused ports )&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Phishing attack secure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-would-you-secure-the-cloud&quot;&gt;How would you secure the cloud?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow Defence in Depth and secure physical to data layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steps are as below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Physical security&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;IAM (Identity and Access Management)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DDos, Firewall (Perimeter), IDS/IPS or intelligent thread detection&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;NSG (Network Security Group): Network protection&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;WAF (Web Application Firewall): Compute, Patches, Malware protection etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Application: design/code review of applications installed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data: User azure PaaS services which is by default data at rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HlQDoeU.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-ddos-&quot;&gt;What is DDoS ?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distributed denial of service (DDOS) is when a server is exhausted by serving large numbers malicious requests and could not serve genuine requests is called DDoS. It loses CIA principle ( Confidentiality , Integrity and Availability ). Now it is not available for genuine users.  Azure DDoS protection , cloud flare , AWS shield can save you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-ids-or-ips&quot;&gt;What is IDS or IPS?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IDS (IIntrusion Detection System)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Been around for quite awhile, fairly common and easier to set up. Logs alerts and events for later analysis&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allows for reactive response / research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IPS ( Intrusion Prevention System)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Newer platform over the last few years&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enables prevention (such as blocking IP addresses, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;False positives could block legitimate traffic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-dhcp&quot;&gt;What is DHCP?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) This is a server that assigns automatically/dynamically IP to connected hosts or servers. Suppose you have 300K systems then you use DHCP. How does it work? Whenever a new system comes up. It sends a broadcast (“Hey I am new in the network I need an address” ) called DHCP discover. All the DHCP servers will respond ( called as DHCP offer ). If there are 10 DHCP servers the client will receive 10 IPs then the client has to send a DHCP request to his favorite or desired DHCP server.  Then the server sends back a DHCP acknowledgement to the client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-vlan&quot;&gt;What is a VLAN? &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VLAN (virtual local area network) You have 100 computers in one switch and within one subnet. Limit the finance to access the things only they need. Finance, HR, Sales, ITOps team might need access to everything. You can virtualize your switch to chop into multiple virtual logical switches. This way you can enhance security for those logical groups of computers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-4K5aHg-iw&amp;amp;list=PL0azhNeBK66KfW04TZBQWkX62hhnFcb9E&amp;amp;index=3&amp;amp;ab_channel=GoCloudArchitects&quot;&gt;Cloud Architect Technical Interview (Master The Cloud Architect Interview Questions!)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-vlan-trunking&quot;&gt;What is VLAN Trunking?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 VLAN in single switch and another 4 in other switch u run a single cable between them to establish connection. That is called VLAN Trunking? How do you do it in a private and secure manner? The trunk has a tag for a VLAN. Each VLAN will get its own IEEE 802.1Q tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qbywToj.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a cloud computing environment. On-premise to Azure cloud when you do direct connection or express route. You send data over VLAN over a Trunk. Azure takes your information and your VLAN Tag and keeps it separate from other customers’ traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-the-difference-between-a-hybrid-cloud-and-a-full-cloud-environment--and-what-are-the-advantages-of-each&quot;&gt;What’s the difference between a hybrid cloud and a full cloud environment ? And what are the advantages of each?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hybrid Cloud architecturally speaking you have your datacenter that has servers, compute, storage, networking and security and you also have the cloud. And you have both connected to get the benefits  of your current infrastructure and connect the cloud to get the agility, scaling, and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Performance: You get lower latency from your datacenter compared to the cloud. Also you get control in case the cloud is down and you have your datacenter still running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OY5bEW8.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Native Cloud has No maintenance switch, routing, cooling, heating, physical security etc. If you are a new company and you don’t have money for capex then you should use cloud. So you save money and only spend on OPEX. You get more speed and scaling, reliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-can-autoscaling-help-with-ddos-protection&quot;&gt;How can autoscaling help with DDoS protection?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hackers control multiple computers and they send requests to your network and overwhelm your systems. If your system can handle 10K web requests and DDoS is giving 30K requests per system. Each of the systems had autoscaling enabled. Then automatically when the system will be over utilized (75% or more) cloud will add a new system and load balance them. So now you spawn up 10 diff systems and now you can handle 50K requests. So the DDoS attack was controlled by auto scaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-classful-ip-addressing-and-problems&quot;&gt;What is Classful IP Addressing and problems?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classful IP addressing host counts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Class A - 16 million host identifiers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Class B - 65535 host identifiers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Class C - 254   host identifiers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classful IP addressing IP ranges:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Class A 1.0.0.0-127.255.255.255 with mask 255.0.0.0 or (/8 in CIDR), 16 millions (2^24-2) IPs and 2^7 Networks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Class B 128.0.0.0-191.255.255.255 with default subnet mask of 255.255.0.0 (/16 in CIDR) 65K (2^16-2) IPs and 2^14 Networks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Class C 192.0.0.0-223.255.255.255 with default subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 (/24in CIDR) 254 (2^8-2) IPS and 2^21 Networks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Class D and E are reserved for multicasts. 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem would commonly occur when an organization required more than 254 host machines and therefore would no longer fall into class C but rather class B. This means that the organization would use a class B license even though they had far less than 65,535 hosts. Therefore if an organization only required 2,500 hosts, they would be wasting about 63,000 hosts by holding a class B license which would greatly decrease the availability of IPv4 addresses unnecessarily&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-cidr&quot;&gt;What is CIDR?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) divides the IP address in network ID and host Id. CIDR is also known as supernetting. It is a method of allocating IP address and IP routing. It replaces the old school of classful IP addressing. CIDR is based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/variable-length-subnet-mask&quot;&gt;variable-length subnet masking&lt;/a&gt; (VLSM). This allows it to define prefixes of arbitrary lengths making it much more efficient than the old system. CIDR IP addresses are composed of two sets of numbers. The network address is written as a prefix, like you would see a normal IP address (e.g. 192.255.255.255). The second part is the suffix which indicates how many bits are in the entire address (e.g. /12). Putting it together, a CIDR IP address would look like the following: 192.255.255.255/12. The network prefix is also specified as part of the IP address. This varies depending upon the number of bits required. Therefore, taking the example above, we can say that the first 12 bits are the network part of the address while the last 20 bits are for host addresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-sqs&quot;&gt;What is SQS?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple Queueing System. Decouple A and B so you can scale both of them independently. It is used to decouple 2 independent components or microservices by giving reliable communication mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-autoscaling&quot;&gt;What is autoscaling?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buy the biggest server to meet your busiest day. On Christmas they get 10M requests. They can buy VMs and put them in an auto scaling group to scale automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However in the cloud you get an autoscaling group for EC2 instances in AWS and you have Virtual Machine Scale Set in Microsoft Azure cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you just need to define:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Desired Capacity : 2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Minimum Capacity : 2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maximum Size: 10 when 75% of both machine is reach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-load-balancer-why-do-you-use-it&quot;&gt;What is a Load Balancer? Why do you use it?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a server or a hardware that will determine which server to send traffic. To share the traffic. What if a single server failed because of load. You don’t have redundancy. For designing High  Performance, High Available web applications, you need a load balancer. Load balancers increase the availability and performance of your system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can divide the load balancer in 2 parts: network and application load balancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Network Load Balancers are really fast because they work at layer -4. They are looking at TCP headers and they are pushing  at your servers. So if you want high performance you need a network load balancer. Cross-Region or global load balancing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Application Load Balancers work at layer-7 so it is a web-traffic load balancer so they enable us to manage traffic to your web application. SSL termination, cookie-based session, round robin for load-balancing traffic. If you want application intelligence and routing then use this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to route between microservices then use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;API Gateway offers below which ALB does not:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It integrates with IAM&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Authentication &amp;amp; Authorization&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;API Tokens issuing and managing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Throttling&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Caching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-firewall&quot;&gt;What is Firewall?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It blocks traffic at the edge of your network,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it keeps your network secure&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It blocks all traffic denied by policies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It lets your outbound traffic back if it’s coming from you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A firewall protects the perimeter of the edge of your network. It is a security appliance that’s basically standing guard saying you are not allowed in, you are allowed. It looks at traffic based on policy. By default it will block all the traffic from coming in. It will allow your internal traffic out on the internet and it will allow all your return traffic back through the firewall. Because Firewalls are Stateful therefore. Within perimeter if Mike wants to open google.com. Firewall is Stateful it will say okay Mike started the session, let his return traffic come back because, I know it’s destined for mike and  I know it’s related to the same session where Mike requested google.com.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-cloud-computing-affect-an-organizations-costs&quot;&gt;How does cloud computing affect an organization’s costs?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saves capital cost. Costs like Workstation, firewall, load balancer, cooling, networking, power etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operation cost also like : Electric bill, Network, staff&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Move to the cloud, nothing to buy. You can do lift and shift and save capex. You only pay for what you use. Your Capex goes down and Opex goes up. Agility benefit, u can spawn up vms fastly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-vpc-flow-logs--nsg-flow-log-in-azure&quot;&gt;What are VPC flow Logs ? NSG flow log In Azure?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In networking we have Cisco NetFlow. It will examine the traffic, they would cross cisco routers and you could say, hm the traffic all going from here to end point B and check for security violation. You can find areas of congestion in your network. Check any issue on network traffic and troubleshoot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vpc flow log gives info about traffic flow. They are excellent for any network troubleshooting especially in security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will tell you below things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Source&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Destination&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Protocols&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Port number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something accepted by ACL but rejected by security group. If this traffic was supposed to be a web app hosted in a VM and you want to know why it got rejected by SG. Check the VPC flow logs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-needed-for-a-simple-lift-and-shift-of-a-system-to-the-cloud&quot;&gt;What’s needed for a simple lift and shift of a system to the cloud?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Define the configuration of the server like How many cores, RAM and Storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-difference-between-latency-based-routing-and-geolocation-based-routing&quot;&gt;What is the difference between Latency based Routing and Geolocation based routing?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latency routing is for speed and performance, geo-location routing will also optimize the speed and performance however it will also send traffic to appropriate websites based on their locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latency based routing determines the lowest latency and sends you to the web server with the lowest latency so you get the best experience&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latency based routing done by Traffic Manager/Front door&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geolocation routing looks at the source IP address and determines what is closest to you and sends them to a different destination. Example you can check IP and decide province and route to that website. For Finch province route to the French website. Route the English province to the English website. If you are dealing with a company having Multi Language websites there, use this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-difference-between-a-region-an-availability-zone-an-edge-location-and-local-zone&quot;&gt;What is the difference between a region, an availability zone, an edge location and local zone?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-region&quot;&gt;What is Region?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS has the concept of a Region, which is a physical location around the world where we cluster data centers. We call each group of logical data centers an Availability Zone. Each AWS Region consists of multiple, isolated, and physically separate AZs within a geographic area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-availability-zone&quot;&gt;What is Availability Zone?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &amp;lt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/&quot;&gt;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt; An Availability Zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity in an AWS Region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-local-zones&quot;&gt;What is Local Zones?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &amp;lt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/&quot;&gt;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones/&quot;&gt;AWS Local Zones&lt;/a&gt; place compute, storage, database, and other select AWS services closer to end-users. This is for critical latency systems like Games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-edge-location&quot;&gt;What is Edge Location?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &amp;lt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/&quot;&gt;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt; Edge location is Reliable, low latency and high throughput network connectivity. Amazon CloudFront peers with thousands of Tier 1/2/3 telecom carriers globally, is well connected with all major access networks for optimal performance, and has hundreds of terabits of deployed capacity. CloudFront Edge locations are connected to the AWS Regions through the AWS network backbone - fully redundant, multiple 100GbE parallel fiber that circles the globe and links with tens of thousands of networks for improved origin fetches and dynamic content acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To deliver content to end users with lower latency, Amazon CloudFront uses a global network of 225+ Points of Presence (215+ Edge locations and 13 regional mid-tier caches) in 90 cities across 47 countries. Amazon CloudFront Edge locations are located in: North America, Europe, Asia etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &amp;lt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/features/?whats-new-cloudfront.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&amp;amp;whats-new-cloudfront.sort-order=desc&quot;&gt;https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/features/?whats-new-cloudfront.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&amp;amp;whats-new-cloudfront.sort-order=desc&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-iam-1&quot;&gt;What is IAM?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AAA (authentication, authorization and accounting)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who is allowed in the system, What they can do and Track what they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-an-8021q-tag&quot;&gt;What is an 802.1Q tag?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VLAN is a subnet in the cloud. Take a physical switch and virtualize them here are examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Port 10-20 vlan -2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Port 20-30 vlan -3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Port 30-40 vlan-4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a single physical connection coming from on-premise to cloud vlan network using 802.1Q tag. With 802.1q tag aws separate your traffic from other customers for direct connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-cdn&quot;&gt;What is CDN?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon CloudFront is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency, high transfer speeds, all within a developer-friendly environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &amp;lt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/&quot;&gt;https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Speed up content&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reduce network bandwidth to aws network&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Closer to user&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Guaranteed performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of going to Amazon.com go to dns and data center. It goes to CDN and you are calling from Miami and serving the site from that location. If cdn has not site cached then it can go fastly to the datacenter and fetch the content since cdn is on aws edge location which is connected to the aws backbone network. Reducing load on web server and Transfer cost on AWS or any cloud network for other cloud service providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-process-to-take-a-web-server-and-make-it-publicly-available-on-the-internet-if-you-are-inside-of-the-aws-cloud-&quot;&gt;What is the process to take a web server and make it publicly available on the internet if you are inside of the AWS cloud ?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will take an external public IP from amazon pool and assign it to EC2 instance. From EC2 now you want the default router to be the internet router. Therefore, you need an internet gateway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-optimal-subnet-size-for-a-point-to-point-wan-link&quot;&gt;What is the optimal subnet size for a point-to-point WAN link?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer is /30 So I got 4 IP 2 reserved and got 2 free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;192.168.0.0/30&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;192.168.0.1/30&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;192.168.0.2/30&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;192.168.0.3/30&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0.0.0.0&lt;/code&gt; reserved for  internet and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;255.255.255.255&lt;/code&gt;  is for broadcast&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-difference-between-iops-and-throughput&quot;&gt;What is the difference between IOPS and throughput?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IOPS&lt;/strong&gt; (input output per seconds) determines how frequently you can read and write to the disc and how  fast. IOPS is related to latency the higher the IOPS, meaning the more read/write operations per second, the lower the latency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NVME&lt;/strong&gt; (Non-Volatile Memory Express) is faster than SSD. Both NVME and SSD drives tend to have relatively low latency because the read/write operations are very fast or the IOPS are very fast. Magnetic drives have much higher latency and much lower IOPS. But if you put a bunch of Magnetic drives together in a RAID environment you can still get great THROUGHOUT. IOPS inversely proposal to Latency&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The higher IOPS the lower latency and the latency on the network and vice versa. THROUGHPUT is the amount of stuff and data that can be moved at any one period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example: cars run 55 mph then its throughput would be whatever it could stuff in the trunk, or the boot, But if you had a Freight Train with 55 mph then you could carry a lot more  stuff. And the stuff is the THROUGHPUT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;IOPS = LATENCY
THROUGHPUT = The amount of STUFF
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use case of IOPS and Throughput:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video editors need a drive that needs high throughput because they are working with large video files but they can tolerate the latency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A database needs extreme speed in terms of read and write operation but it is not moving large amounts of data then it needs higher IOPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-difference-between-acl-and-nsg-&quot;&gt;What is the difference between ACL and NSG ?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access Control Lists (ACL) is a Networking concept. It keeps traffic out of the subnet and Network Security Group (NSG) keeps traffic out of the Host. ACL protects the subnet and NSG protects the server. ACLs are stateless meaning it is not tracking the state of the connection. The traffic that is allowed in is not being monitored, so therefore, you don’t know a lot of return traffic. So rules in ACL have to be applied in both directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NSG is just like a firewall, it is stateful so you have to only enable the inbound direction. So if traffic is coming to the host then the return traffic is allowed from the same host back to the source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ACL works at layer -3, NSG is stateful They are stateful, meaning that they allow return traffic to flow. In general allow everything in and out and block the specific one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stateful-vs-stateless&quot;&gt;Stateful vs Stateless?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stateful services keep track of sessions or transactions and react differently to the same inputs based on that history. Stateless services rely on clients to maintain sessions and center around operations that manipulate resources, rather than the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ACL is stateless&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Firewall is stateful&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;NSG is stateful both in AWS and Azure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-raid-0-1-5--10&quot;&gt;What is RAID 0, 1, 5 , 10?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) is a virtual disk technology that combines multiple physical drives into one unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raid-0&lt;/strong&gt;: Stripping, high speed, no FT, 100% capacity, data can not be recovered&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raid-1&lt;/strong&gt;: Mirroring , normal speed, FT, 50% capacity, data can be recovered when 1 disk crash, during 1 disk crash performance remains same, minimum 2 disk required. If you have 2 , 10TB drives you get only 1TB of storage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raid-5&lt;/strong&gt;: Stripping with Parity, High Throughput and normal IOPS,  normal speed, FT, 1 disk capacity we lose, minimum 3 disk we need, 1 disk for parity bit, if any 1 disk failed data can be recovered, during disk failure performance become more down because it has to calculate the parity bit, capacity wise 1 disk capacity lost and used for parity saving&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raid-10&lt;/strong&gt;: Stripping and Mirroring together,  logical drive made of raid 0 and raid 1, first we create 2 raid 0 disks (4) then we combine them to a logical drive called raid 1. finally it becomes raid 10. This gives high performance, FT, and capacity is 50% when 2 disks are lost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stripping&lt;/strong&gt; means distributing bits in different disk and hence faster write because per disk you write very less  bit and parallely you write so your write and read both are faster. Here you get speed however you don’t get Fault Tolerance one disk fails then entire data is lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mirroring&lt;/strong&gt; means duplicating means while writing you write all bits simultaneously in 2 different disks to keep redundant disk and protect from data loss. Mirroring does not slow down read write since its writing parallely in 2 disks together. However, since you are writing all bits in one disk at a time, it is slower than the Stripping technique. Here you do not get stripping technology disk speed however you get fault tolerance so if one disk failed then you still can recover your data since you had other disk available as redundant. You have to pay more for mirroring since you want to store 1 TB then you need 2TB for redundancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need guaranty consistent  latency  and  guaranty bandwidth use Direct connection since it is connected with direct wire. Costly option. Use the VPN because it is cheaper, works with the internet, and is flexible since everyone has the internet. You can create connections on demand. It was easy to connect to multiple remote sites. The side is you depend on internet bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-function-is-achieved-with-ipsec&quot;&gt;What function is achieved with IPSEC?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IPSec provides the ability to authenticate each remote end to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. And it ensures the integrity of the data because it uses a hashing algorithm to encrypt the payload. IPSec provides Non-Repudiation means Assurance that the sender of information is provided with proof of delivery and the recipient is provided with proof of the sender’s identity, so neither can later deny having processed the information. Also it provides the tunnel for private IP addresses and private traffic and private routing information over public networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &amp;lt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/non_repudiation&quot;&gt;https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/non_repudiation&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt; It is a replacement of internet protocol. IPsec is a suite of protocols. IP protocol and security protocol. It encrypts the payload and keeps the header un-encrypted. It is used in VPN to  create a tunnel of encryption from on-premise to cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-can-you-scale-relational-databases&quot;&gt;How can you scale relational databases?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask the question what type of traffic is being used by your database?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s a combination of read and write traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have read traffic more then create read replicas and offload the read work to read replicas. Which will free up resources on the master database. You can further reduce the load on read replicas by adding some caching. In order to reduce write load, so you don’t have peaks and valleys you can use queuing system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;acid-vs-base-&quot;&gt;ACID vs BASE ?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relational DB is ACID by nature:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Atomicity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consistency&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Isolation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Durability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NoSQL are BASE by nature:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Basic Availability: Application must handle partial failures itself&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Soft State: DB state can change even without inputs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Eventually Consistency: • DB will “eventually” become consistent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-virtualization-how-does-it-work-and-why-will-you-use-it&quot;&gt;What is virtualization, how does it work and why will you use it?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a bare metal server, add a hypervisor and create a virtual machine on the hypervisor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/GvUVlj3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;block-storage-and-object-storage-how-they-work-what-are-their-advantages&quot;&gt;Block Storage and Object Storage how they work, what are their advantages?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need storage on a VM that does not go away with reboot, you are going to use something like block storage. If you have a static website or you want to distribute software, you are going to use something like object storage. If you are going to create data-lake , use object storage. If you need high performance storage you will use block storage. Object storage is cheap and can store large volumes of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;object-storage&quot;&gt;Object Storage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Object in the object storage is consist of :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unique Id: 128 bit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Expandable metadata: contextual data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/uG9uip3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/chlbywt.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Objects can’t be modified—you have to write the object completely at once. Object storage also doesn’t work well with traditional databases, because writing objects is a slow process and writing an app to use an object storage API isn’t as simple as using file storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &amp;lt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/data-storage/file-block-object-storage&quot;&gt;https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/data-storage/file-block-object-storage&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;block-storage&quot;&gt;Block Storage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Block storage chops data into blocks—get it?—and stores them as separate pieces. Each block of data is given a unique identifier, which allows a storage system to place the smaller pieces of data wherever is most convenient. That means that some data can be stored in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux&quot;&gt;Linux®&lt;/a&gt; environment and some can be stored in a Windows unit. It is usually deployed in storage-area network (SAN) environments and must be tied to a functioning server. Block storage can be expensive. It has limited capability to handle metadata, which means it needs to be dealt with at the application or database level—adding another thing for a developer or systems administrator to worry about. From &amp;lt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/data-storage/file-block-object-storage&quot;&gt;https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/data-storage/file-block-object-storage&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-nat-and-why-would-you-use-it&quot;&gt;What Is NAT and Why would you use it?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Network address translation and its really about translating one IP address to another address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now they could be used to connect private addresses to the internet by translating it into a public address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-stateful-firewall-or-aws-nsg&quot;&gt;What is Stateful Firewall or AWS NSG?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stateful means watching the state of the connection, they keep the context of the route and remember which request is initiated from which host. If you dis-allowed outbound to port 80 then automatically inbound flights are prohibited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you initiate a connection it goes through the firewall on the way out to the internet. The firewall looks at your connection and it tracks what you have done. Because when a response comes it will allow you to back in because it knows you initiated the connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-connecting-to-aws-when-would-you-use-direct-or-vpn-connection&quot;&gt;When connecting to AWS when would you use direct or VPN connection?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Direct connection is a wired connection from your on-premise  route to Cloud provider router. You can use either use your ISP or direct Microsoft to connect direct connections. If you want guaranty bandwidth, performance and latency use direct connect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VPN is You connect to the internet on both side and then you create a tunnel and you encrypt your data over the internet. So the internet Is not private and that’s why you have to encrypt your data. When you use a VPN it is cheaper because you are not buying a direct connection. You are connecting to the internet. VPN are really simple to setup because you can basically you can create any connection to any place that has internet connectivity, which is wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;advantages-of-vpn&quot;&gt;Advantages of VPN&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Econmical&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flexible&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Easy to setup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;disadvantages-of-vpn&quot;&gt;Disadvantages of VPN&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Internet bandwidth and performance is not guarantied. Your ISP may guarantee you access to them but when you are on their network and off their network and on the internet there are no guarantees.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Internet is called best effort delivered if you try to reach webpage it does mean its going to get there. It should, it will try but it will not be guarantied.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;So internet speed is high you get good performance if low then you get bad performance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Latency is not guaranty in direct connect you get 3 ms to reach.  In VPN message1 can take 2 ms. Message2 takes 100 ms and then message3 takes 5 ms. So message2 can arrive after message3 and that may be a horrible situation. Message2 takes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/uVEAiQQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hFY5zPj.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, no physical tunnel exists, of course; the data has to travel through the same wires as any other data passing through the public network. Rather, VPN tunneling employs the concepts known as data encapsulation and encryption to safely carry data traffic through the non-secure environment. Encapsulation insulates the packet of data from other data traveling over the same network, while encryption makes the data “invisible” (unreadable) even to surveillance agents and criminals who recognize it as encrypted information. So it’s like the data is traveling inside a tunnel. Figure 1.0 below might help you visualize the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can think of VPN tunneling as similar to the process of moving physical cash from one bank location to another using an armored transport van along public highways. The cash in this instance is your data, the public highway is the non-secure public network, and the armored van is analogous to a VPN tunnel (data encapsulation and encryption).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-bgp-and-why-is-it-used&quot;&gt;What is BGP and why is it used?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is layer 4 protocol. It is an exterior gateway protocol and it works with a path vector routing protocol that operates on TCP port 179. When you connect an entity to an external entity, that’s when you use an exterior gateway. That’s why organization use BGP to connect to AWS or GCP as opposed to something like OSPF (Open Shortest Path First,  small routing within campus networks) or EIGRP (enhanced interior gateway routing protocol, used in networks of large commercial companies ) &lt;a href=&quot;https://networkjourney.com/difference-between-eigrp-ospf-vs-bgp-routing-protocols/&quot;&gt;https://networkjourney.com/difference-between-eigrp-ospf-vs-bgp-routing-protocols/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BGP is highly Tunable and highly scalable. For example if an internet routing table has basically 3 quarters of a million routes and BGP can easily handle that, whereas an interior gateway routing protocol could not. That’s why organizations use BGP to connect to external entities like AWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BGP Routing preferences sequence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Largest weight&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Largest local preference&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shortest number of autonomous system hops&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lowest Med (metric)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to select the next hop BGP checks who has the maximum weight that route it will take, next it will prefer maximum local preference, next shortest number of system hops, next lowest metric. This way it optimizes the route selection and data transfer over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-are-designing-a-video-streaming-software-what-should-you-use-tcp-or-udp-for-which-and-why&quot;&gt;You are designing a video streaming software. What should you use TCP or UDP for? Which and why?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must be UDP. TCP is used for reliable transport. UDP is used for Realtime transport. Why? If I send this “Rupesh like design” via UDP and  I receive “Rupesh Design” I lost like If I send this “Rupesh like design” via TCP and  I receive “Rupesh Design Like” I lost, then TCP will retransmit the Like and you get the data in different order. For video streaming you do not want this behavior. All streaming things must be UDP! Because it is better, faster for these applications. There are no sliding windows. Performance is going to be what it’s going to be and there is no re-transmission on lost data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-cxo-and-what-does-it-mean-to-present-differently-to-a-cxo-vs-an-engineer&quot;&gt;What is CXO and what does it mean to present differently to a CXO vs an Engineer?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CXO means a C-Level executive:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;COO&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CFO&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CEO&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CIO (chief information officer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CXO means a C-level executive. They are extremely busy people. Because they are so busy they have an attention span of a few seconds at max. So you got to get your concept to the executive out to the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you must talk about things that they care about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CEO is tasked with the organization’s strategy and increasing shareholder value meaning revenue growth or profitability growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CFO cares about the organization’s finances. They are the gatekeeper for the organization’s money. When you are presenting to the CFO, you better be really good at basically doing some ROI (return on investment) modeling and showing that the value provided by your solution, provides greater  value and savings or profitability to the company than it’s cost. You have to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CIO wants to know your technology solution is going to meet the CEO’s goals and needs. So you have to present this and it’s going to work. Now when you are dealing with the Engineers, they might need a lot of technical depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presenting to the executive should be “SHORT to the POINT and the Solution”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presenting to the engineer should be to dive deep and present how it works technically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most companies, the board of directors and the founders are at the top of the corporate hierarchy followed by the C-level executives namely the CEO, COO, CFO, etc. … Usually Vice Presidents (VPs) and Senior Vice Presidents (SVPs) report to C-level executives. &lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.workable.com/hr-terms/c-level-executive&quot;&gt;https://resources.workable.com/hr-terms/c-level-executive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-organization-strategy-mean&quot;&gt;What does organization strategy mean?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An organizational strategy is a plan that specifies how your business will allocate resources (e.g., money, labor, and inventory) to support infrastructure, production, marketing, inventory, and other business activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-shareholder&quot;&gt;What is a Shareholder?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A shareholder is a party that legally owns shares of a company’s stock. Shareholders who own less than 50% of a company’s stock are known as ‘minority shareholders’, whereas shareholders who own 50% or more of a company’s stock are called ‘majority shareholders’.  Shareholders are owners of the company, but they are not liable for the company’s debts.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Owners and shareholders&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Employees of the company&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bondholder.asp&quot;&gt;Bondholders&lt;/a&gt; who own company-issued debt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Customers who may rely on the company to provide a particular good or service&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Suppliers and vendors who may rely on the company to provide a consistent revenue stream&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Stakeholders, however, are bound to the company for a longer term and for reasons of greater need. For example, if a company is performing poorly financially, the vendors in that company’s supply chain might suffer if the company no longer uses their services. Similarly, employees of the company, who are stakeholders and rely on it for income, might lose their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-aws&quot;&gt;What is AWS?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. Millions of customers—including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies—are using AWS to lower costs, become more agile, and innovate faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-cloud-computing&quot;&gt;What is cloud computing?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;infrastructure-as-a-service-iaas&quot;&gt;Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IaaS contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT. It typically provides access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;platform-as-a-service-paas&quot;&gt;Platform as a Service (PaaS)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PaaS removes the need for you to manage underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems), and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-region-1&quot;&gt;What is Region?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An AWS Region is a physical location in the world where we have multiple Availability Zones. Each Amazon Region is designed to be completely isolated from the other AWS Regions. This achieves the greatest possible fault tolerance and stability. AWS has 25 AWS regions with 240 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-availability-zone&quot;&gt;What is the Availability Zone?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Availability Zones consist of one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity, housed in separate facilities. These Availability Zones offer you the ability to operate production applications and databases that are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than would be possible from a single data center.  Each Availability Zone is designed as an independent failure zone. This means that Availability Zones are physically separated within a typical metropolitan region and are located in lower risk flood plains (specific flood zone categorization varies by AWS Region).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-nas&quot;&gt;What is NAS?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Network attached storage. Centralize storage device for storing data on a network. I will have multiple hard drives in a RAID  configuration. Used in home and small side business. It has a NIC so that you can connect this with a switch or router to be in the network and then you can access it from laptop, desktop mobile etc. It can be accessed as a shared drive. It has a single point of failure, if power supply fail in the NAS then other devices will not able to access it.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-san&quot;&gt;What is SAN?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storage area network is special. SANs are a highly scalable, highly redundant and high speed network that stores and provides access to large amounts of data. SAN is fault tolerant since data is shared among several disk arrays. If a switch, disk array or server goes down data can still be accessed. Server accesses this data as if it was a local attached hard drive. In NAS it is recognized as a network drive. All other devices in SAN are connected to each other using fiber channel (fiber optics ) 2 -128 gbps speed. Fiber channel is very costly. The other option is iSCSI (Internet Small Computer System Interface) which is a cheaper alternative to using Fiber channel but they are not very fast.  SANs are not affected by network traffic happening in LAN because SANs are not part of LAN. SANs are partitioned off, it’s basically a network all by itself.  SANs are very expensive therefore, only large company, enterprises can afford this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some important slides from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yZDDr0JKVc&amp;amp;ab_channel=PowerCertAnimatedVideos&quot;&gt;NAS vs SAN - Network Attached Storage vs Storage Area Network&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-scalability&quot;&gt;What is Scalability?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scalability is the ability of a system to increase workload by adding resources. Scale up, down, out or in. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8F2ls3n_Wo&amp;amp;ab_channel=zeisys&quot;&gt; Scalability vs Elasticity in 99 seconds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-elasticity&quot;&gt;What is Elasticity?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elasticity is the ability to automatically match the resources  sufficient for a given workload size.&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8F2ls3n_Wo&amp;amp;ab_channel=zeisys&quot;&gt;Scalability vs Elasticity in 99 seconds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;network-load-balancer-vs-application-load-balancer&quot;&gt;Network load balancer vs Application load balancer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Application load balancer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;URL routing can be done in&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In level -7  (application)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Low performance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Load balance frontend servers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Network load balancer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In level -4 (transport)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;High performance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Load balance backend servers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Do you have a lot of JavaScript projects using GitHub repositories? How are you managing dependencies among those projects? Developers might be struggling to manage a large set of GitHub repositories and Business might be spending a lot of money to manage them. The potential solution to this problem is Monorepo. You can put all of your JavaScript projects regardless of framework (angular, vue.js, react.js) in a single GitHub repository called monorepo. This will solve the problem and you will not have many Git projects. However, nothing is free! So there are many challenges with monorepo that developers are facing. I will explain all of the challenges and show you how you can solve them. Also I will create monorepo from scratch in this article using angular projects as samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-monorepo&quot;&gt;What is Monorepo?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Single Git Repository holds source code of multiple applications and libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-to-use-monorepo&quot;&gt;Why to use Monorepo?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monorepo in organization helps you to get below benefits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared Code&lt;/strong&gt;: Reuse code validation, tooling code, and libraries code in applications in a single repository.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atomic Changes&lt;/strong&gt;: Change the button component in the shared library and update the application that uses that button in the same commit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developer Mobility&lt;/strong&gt;: Developers can easily contribute to any applications or libraries by just going to one source code repository.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-should-i-know-before-using-monorepo&quot;&gt;What should I know before using Monorepo?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have already developed couple of JavaScript projects then you are good to go and learn Monorepo. For this article if you have basic knowledge of Angular then it will be good since I will create angular projects in example monorepo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-is-source-code-for-nx-monorepo&quot;&gt;Where is source code for Nx Monorepo?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/nx&quot;&gt;Nx npm package&lt;/a&gt; that you can use from npm. For this article I will demonstrate code that is hosted in github at below location:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rupeshtiwari/coding-examples-angular-monorepo-with-nx&quot;&gt;Angular Monorepo Nrwl.NX sample&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rupeshtiwari/coding-examples-angular-monorepo-nx-azure-ci-cd&quot;&gt;Angular Monorepo Nrwl.NX sample with advance Microsoft Azure CI/CD Pipeline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;challenges-with-monorepo&quot;&gt;Challenges with Monorepo?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenges are how to identify which application depends on how many projects? How to constrain dependency so that it reduces cyclic dependency issues and organizes code structure? How to only compile the project which has only changed? How to only run tests for the changed projects? How to increase tooling speed for a large set of projects in a single monorepo? How to manage versions? All of these are very important requirements. Nx.Nrwl monorepo framework is an excellent framework to manage any number of JavaScript projects in just one GitHub Repo. With Nx.Nrwl Monorepo you get facility to visualize which project depends on others. All of the challenges that I mentioned could be resolved by Nx Monorepo. Stay tuned and read this article till the end to create your angular monorepo from scratch using the Nx Monorepo framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-manage-versions-and-parallel-development&quot;&gt;How to manage versions and parallel development?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could have your own policy as per your organization’s need to manage parallel development, release, fix, development, merging, major release, maintenance related work. However, I am suggesting one option. Let’s see if that makes sense to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;managing-releases-with-monorepo&quot;&gt;Managing Releases with Monorepo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a branch for release number. Example &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;releases/11.0&lt;/code&gt; treat this branch as active working branch. You can treat this as your &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dev&lt;/code&gt; branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/SQUdxd4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;working-on-feature-branch-with-monorepo&quot;&gt;Working on Feature Branch with Monorepo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For adding new feature or working on some new PBI or usecase. Create a features folder and put PBI number as new branch in features folder work on development and merge them in to release branch.
Example: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;features/PBI123/appendOrder&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;managing-major-releases-with-monorepo&quot;&gt;Managing Major Releases with Monorepo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to do major release create a new branch &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;11.1&lt;/code&gt; as major release branch. And if you want to apply fix on &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;11.1&lt;/code&gt; then create another branch &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;11.1.1&lt;/code&gt; work on fixes and merge them back to release branch &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;11.0&lt;/code&gt; for future release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/F4rqVdP.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-developer-will-learn-in-this-article&quot;&gt;What Developer will learn in this article?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, I will walk you through the steps to create one &lt;a href=&quot;https://nx.dev/&quot;&gt;nx monorepo&lt;/a&gt; workspace with Angular application and libraries from empty preset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We will use Azure Pipeline Caching to improve build speed by caching npm packages.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We will publish our application to npm from pipeline in automated fashion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-the-monorepo-we-will-do-below-work&quot;&gt;In the Monorepo we will do below work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I need &lt;strong&gt;Karma&lt;/strong&gt; as test runner&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I &lt;strong&gt;don’t need e2e test&lt;/strong&gt; for applications&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I want my &lt;strong&gt;applications to be publishable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I want my &lt;strong&gt;libraries to be not publishable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create &lt;strong&gt;Azure CI/CD pipelines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deploy &lt;strong&gt;Application to NPM registry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;development-environment-setup&quot;&gt;Development Environment Setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey developer, make sure you have &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;node.js&lt;/code&gt; installed which is greater than &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;V10&lt;/code&gt;. I have installed &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;node.js v14&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;visual-studio-code-vscode&quot;&gt;Visual Studio Code (VsCode)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am using Vs Code and installed nx console extension to get inbuilt way of creating apps/libs from nx console only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;visual-studio-code-extensions&quot;&gt;Visual Studio Code Extensions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install below VsCode extensions for better development experience:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Below are optional but recommended extensions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wayou.vscode-todo-highlight&quot;&gt;TODO Highlighter&lt;/a&gt; : Optional it helps to highlight todo and fixme comments.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/JT28IhH.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FixMe Comments&lt;/strong&gt;
FIXME: Comments are some things that you are planning to fix within the current sprint.&lt;br /&gt;
Example: Fixing Api Service to call Server Web API within this sprint only.
Stories having FIXME are alarming for you. Make sure all FIXME’s are addressed before marking stories are done. 📓 Notice: Once you fix the code then remove the comment 😄
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Zgbdf9N.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Todo Comments&lt;/strong&gt;
TODO: comments are something that you are planning to work on future sprints.
Example: Working on MCQ API Service to call server side API that has to be done on future sprint.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/i48KY0n.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check all todo comments &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CTRL + SHIFT + P&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to get the custom icons for your files then make sure you have installed VSCode Materials and copy below settings and paste in your local VSCode settings.json file located at &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;%appdata%\Code\User\settings.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will get below icons once updating settings file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enable-karma-test-runner-in-nx-monorepo&quot;&gt;Enable Karma Test Runner in Nx Monorepo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you create nx monorepo with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Angular&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;React&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Next.js&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Gatsby&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;next.js&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Web Components&lt;/code&gt; then it will give you &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;JEST&lt;/code&gt; as unit test runner. In case you want to get &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;karma&lt;/code&gt; test runner then you have to create Empty workspace and then add &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@nrwl/angular&lt;/code&gt; then add new application or lib with karma unit test runner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-first-nx-monorepo-using-cli&quot;&gt;Creating First Nx Monorepo using CLI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to create your first Nx Monorepo workspace run below script:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npx create-nx-workspace@latest&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Give workspace name: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;myorg&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select Layout: I select Angular Application (A workspace with a single Angular Application)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Application Name: cutepuppies-admin&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stylesheet Format: SASS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Linter: TSLINT&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nx Cloud: No ( this is default )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/iMK98Jr.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will create the workspace with angular app that we defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/X8fvsUc.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you will use their template they will add end to end test for application. They will also add jest test runner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/GLOkklz.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my workspace, I do not want Jest and I do not want e2e tests. So I am creating my workspace with empty preset next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-nx-monorepo-with-custom-settings&quot;&gt;Creating Nx Monorepo with Custom Settings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npx create-nx-workspace@latest&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Give organization name: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;curise&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Select angular application for the workspace. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;angular&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will install &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@nrwl/angular&lt;/code&gt; plugin to give you tools to create angular lib and apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zia6hBU.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then enter angular application name: admin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jn9PH3x.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Next select Style format as SASS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Default Linter: Choose TSLINT since I have angular app&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nx Cloud give caching over cloud: No ( it needs paid subscription plan)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8XevXrP.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run the script:

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bNRYcQI.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;libs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tools&lt;/strong&gt;
Tools folder has tsconfig file that means u can write typescript files and compile them in JS.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;decorate-angular-cli.js&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;jest.preset.js&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;angular.json&lt;/strong&gt;
It create angular.json file to manage your workspace. However, if you want to create empty monorepo project then it creates &lt;strong&gt;workspace.json&lt;/strong&gt; file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-projects-in-nx-monorepo&quot;&gt;Creating Projects in Nx Monorepo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nx build&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Pig0oei.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;empty-nx-monorepo-advantage-and-disadvantages&quot;&gt;Empty Nx Monorepo Advantage and Disadvantages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After creating empty workspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits of Empty Workspace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;karma&lt;/code&gt; unit test runner&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;workspace.json&lt;/code&gt; to configure any apps and libs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages of empty workspace&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You have to write the angular cli decorator for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Nx CLI&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of empty or pre-populated workspace you must create your own &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CI/CD&lt;/code&gt; Pipelines and Nx commands for your pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-new-empty-nx-monorepo-workspace&quot;&gt;Creating new Empty Nx Monorepo workspace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we will create our monorepo workslpace that we will continue using it. We will start from scratch empty monorepo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating empty Nx Monorepo workspace is our final option for this example. So let’s create desired working folder and from that location open &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;powershell&lt;/code&gt; on windows machine I found working on &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git bash commands&lt;/code&gt; were not working nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run below script to create empty workspace&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npx create-nx-workspace@latest --preset=empty&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above script will ask you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;organization name and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Want to use Nx Cloud or not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2nPySWd.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice it created the workspace&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ApKE767.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Now I get empty app and library folders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vl5KtTa.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my dependencies that I get in package.json&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Y4qQNIe.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-nx-cli-does&quot;&gt;What NX CLI does?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Nx CLI&lt;/code&gt; commands will invoke &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Angular CLI&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Nx CLI&lt;/code&gt; simply does some optimizations before invoking the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Angular CLI&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Nx Cli&lt;/code&gt; can execute all of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng cli&lt;/code&gt; commands. The benefit you get with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Nx CLI&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;Computation Caching&lt;/strong&gt; which gives faster execution of tasks. Also Nx CLI is technology agnostic You can use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Nx CLI&lt;/code&gt; to run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;angular&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;react&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;JavaScript&lt;/code&gt; or any project scripts.
So it gives uniformity in your team to always run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Nx CLI&lt;/code&gt; in your workspace regardless of any front-end technology you are using..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-nx-cli-over-angular-cli&quot;&gt;Using Nx CLI over Angular CLI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to point &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng cli&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Nx CLI&lt;/code&gt; we have to run &lt;strong&gt;decorate-angular-cli.js&lt;/strong&gt; file. Because of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;symlinking&lt;/code&gt; you can still type &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng build&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng test&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng lint&lt;/code&gt; in the terminal. The ng command, in this case, will point to nx, which will perform optimizations before invoking &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After install we can execute this decorator file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-json highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;postinstall&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;node ./decorate-angular-cli.js &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ngcc --properties es2015 browser module main --first-only --create-ivy-entry-points&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-opt-out-of-nx-cli&quot;&gt;How to opt out of NX CLI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I don’t recommend this option :-1:&lt;br /&gt;
However, in case you want to opt out of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NX CLI&lt;/code&gt; then follow below steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Replace occurrences of nx with ng in your package.json&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove the script from your postinstall script in your package.json&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Delete and reinstall your node_modules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are not doing this though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nx console&lt;/code&gt; to create application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I want to create Angular applications and libraries I need &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@nrwl/angular&lt;/code&gt; node package to be
installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;please run below script to install &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@nrwl/angular&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm i -D @nrwl/angular&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/uq8rqan.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Select Nx, then select generate and then select Angular Library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-create-run-command-in-nx-monorepo&quot;&gt;How to create Run Command in NX Monorepo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nx Run Command helps to create custom commands&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6OPfuS6.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target Name&lt;/strong&gt; : Bane of the target like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;build&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Project Name&lt;/strong&gt; : is the name of the project in the workspace.json file : &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;branding-ckeditor&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Command&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm run build&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cwd&lt;/strong&gt; location of the src folder of the project&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;outputs&lt;/strong&gt; where the build artifacts will be stored.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BS0ulgd.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;nx generate @nrwl/workspace:run-commands &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;build &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;npm run build&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;branding-ckeditor5 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--cwd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;libs/branding/ckeditor5/src &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--outputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;libs/branding/ckeditor5 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--no-interactive&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--dry-run&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will update the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;workspace.json&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nx.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/JYPutPu.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nx build branding-ckeditor5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-create-angular-app-using-nx-console&quot;&gt;Step: Create Angular App using Nx Console&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s select an angular application this time to create cutepuppies-admin apps.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step--lets-create-logging-service--tests&quot;&gt;Step : Let’s Create Logging Service &amp;amp; Tests&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s create a loggingService inside our logger project.
Use Nx Console to create angular service.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ynFGEdp.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is dry run result of angular service creation
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oyCwe1b.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fill out the form add below information
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/SZDx1N5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Name: logging
project: branding-logger
Notice Logger service created
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7aLT4Yn.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets run the test and see if the test is passing or not. Since I am using main branch instead of master branch I will update my scripts to take base as main branch only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LQmjidP.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since only logging service is added if I run the test only one project test will run.
Run npm run affected:test
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/owTmYZl.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step--lets-take-logger-dependency-on-our-application&quot;&gt;Step : Let’s take logger dependency on our application&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next lest run the build
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2OAeDSS.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;npm run affected:build
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wfr90IZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice the app is building and the dist folder is created with one app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/noosk8r.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s use a logging service to log something and run our application next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to libs/branding/logger/src/index.ts and export the logger service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7w7SM23.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next go to apps\cutepuppies-admin\src\app\app.component.ts and add logging service and log in constructor.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QGpa6da.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets serve our application run below script&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;nx serve cutepuppies-admin&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wyde0hs.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navigate to http://localhost:4200 and see in console log hello world is coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FMj0LWO.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now lets build the application again and go to the dist folder and run below script from dist folder&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cd dist/apps/cutepuppies-admin &amp;amp;&amp;amp; npx http-server -o&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice our app is running and I see the log as well.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Only apps are buildable and publishable to npm repositories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Libs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Libs are services&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Services should have multiple projects&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Services should not depend on each other&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Services projects should not depend on each other. Unless it is configured to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Services projects can depend on Branding&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Services projects are not buildable and not publishable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Services projects has a libs folder which is equivalent to modules folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we are use pipeline cache, we need to create Artifacts Feed in Azure devops to store the node_modules folders. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/artifacts/concepts/feeds?view=azure-devops&quot;&gt;Learn more about Artifacts Feed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-artifact-feed-in-azure-devops&quot;&gt;Create Artifact Feed in Azure devops&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Artifacts Feeds are organizational constructs that allow you to store, manage, and group your packages and control who to share it with. Feeds are not package-type dependent. You can store all the following package types in a single feed: npm, NuGet, Maven, Python, and Universal packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to Azure Artifacts.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/DaCSK2x.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select Create Feed.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jST8Fj8.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Give your feed a Name and choose its visibility, upstream sources and scope.

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-azure-ci-pipeline&quot;&gt;Creating Azure CI Pipeline&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow steps to create build definition&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-1-create-template-yaml-file&quot;&gt;Step 1: Create Template yaml File&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then go to project and create install-node-module.yml file:
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fLed9Hi.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We will install node.js&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We will write the task to cache the node_modules folder into the azure feed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then we will install node packages if cache does not exist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step--lets-run-the-build-again&quot;&gt;Step : Lets Run the build Again&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice since we have not changed any code we will notice only initial_setup and rest all jobs will be skipped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step--lets-change-the-logger-and-find-out-affected-dependency-graph&quot;&gt;Step : Lets Change the Logger and find out affected dependency graph&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go libs\branding\logger\src\lib\logging.service.ts
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/aeU11m5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm run affected:dep-graph&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Tu2E3ML.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;confirm changes are working Run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm run start-admin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/iVTsegC.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-fix-admin-specs&quot;&gt;Step: Fix admin specs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets create a script to test and watch
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FTvQoP8.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now lets fix the test for admin project correct the title name
Now run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm run affected:test&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will automatically run the admin test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zxF2qE5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-fix-client-specs&quot;&gt;Step: Fix client specs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now lest fix the test for client project correct the title name
Now run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm run affected:test&lt;/code&gt;
It will automatically run the both admin &amp;amp; client test.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step--lets-push-the-code-and-notice-our-builds&quot;&gt;Step : Lets Push the code and notice our Builds&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See this time in the build machine as well it identified&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Only 2 projects to lint and test and they are
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;“branding-logger”,”cutepuppies-admin”&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Only 1 Project to build and that is:”cutepuppies-admin”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice test and build are passing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Yj8uQdv.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step--running-all-lint-build-and-test-as-task&quot;&gt;Step : Running all lint build and test as TASK&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We dont want to trigger these many jobs since our monorepo is not that large. Therefore, I am deciding to create just one job so lets follow below steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-update-the-command-generation-script&quot;&gt;Step: Update the command generation script&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets update the build definition to run them as task within single job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rename the current file to generate-ci-batch-commands.js
And create new file generate-ci-commands.js
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RK1V28L.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/**
 * # Generate Ci command
 * 1. It will identify the affected projects
 * 2. Group the projects in 3 groups for each command.
 * ## Example:
 *  If 3 projects are affected it will create below group for lint, test and build command
 *          lint1:[admin], lint2:[logger], lint3:[client]
 *          build1:[admin], build2:[logger], build3:[client]( if you made buildable for each projects)
 *          test1:[admin], test2:[logger], test3:[client]( if you have tests for each projects)
 *  If 4 projects are affected it will create below group for lint, test and build command
 *          lint1:[admin,ngmaterial], lint2:[logger], lint3:[client]
 *          build1:[admin,ngmaterial], build2:[logger], build3:[client]( if you made buildable for each projects)
 *          test1:[admin,ngmaterial], test2:[logger], test3:[client] ( if you have tests for each projects)

  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;test&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;branding-logger&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;cutepuppies-admin&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;build&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;cutepuppies-admin&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;publish&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;cutepuppies-admin&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I change the client app as well then I should see both apps in publish array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-json highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;lint&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;cutepuppies-client&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;branding-logger&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;cutepuppies-admin&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;test&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;cutepuppies-client&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;branding-logger&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;cutepuppies-admin&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;build&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;cutepuppies-client&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;cutepuppies-admin&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;publish&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;cutepuppies-client&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;cutepuppies-admin&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will add below method for getting publish apps&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;affectedApps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;execSync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`npx nx affected:apps --base=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;baseSha&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;trim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;apps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;apps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;trim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;apps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new script for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;generate-ci-command.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-do-smart-components-do&quot;&gt;What do smart components do? &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can do dependency injection and have service stores  injected.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can only send command&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can only call query methods to store to get some result/data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can not write any filter,sort kind of logic move them in store&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can not publish event&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can not have business query logic or model update logic&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can pass some data structure to nested dumb/presentation components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-dumb--presentation-componetn-can-do&quot;&gt;What is dumb / presentation componetn can do?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No dependency injection for service and store&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Only input and output&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Responsible for rendering data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No message publishing/sending&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No store query no model state mutation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-a-service&quot;&gt;What is a service?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It has business logic and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can take advantage of API service.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most of the services are message handlers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quiz: Where should I write the code to create a mcq widget?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-a-model&quot;&gt;What is a Model?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is a data structure which has state.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It must not have business logic.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can have getters and setters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-a-store&quot;&gt;What is a Store? &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is a collection of models.  If you have multiple models of the same type, create store to retrieve them and put them in the collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t write business logic to mutate the model state in store&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Business logic to mutate model state goes in SERVICES only.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All Model related queries (filter, sort etc ) must be written in the Store that component can call upon.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Store we can write code that does not go in one model and you want span over the multiple instances of the model.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Example: Sorting models inside store, Asserting before inserting model in collection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-an-api-service&quot;&gt;What is an API service?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Makes http network calls and returns promises.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It has httpClient dependency and extends Base API Service.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;API service mostly returns the client side Model object and Server is supposed to return the same Model Data Structure to the client. However, in case there is a mismatch between the result comes from Server vs client. Then Use DTO for server side data structure. DTO should remain under the DATA folder of the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-depends-on-whom-within-a-library-&quot;&gt;Who depends on whom within a library ? &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have component layer, message handlers and api service layers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Component can depend on Model and Message service&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Message Handler can depend on model and api&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;API service can depend on httpclient and dto&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;✅ RUN TEST: npm run affected:test
✅ RUN LINT: npm run affected:lint&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can always run affected projects on your feature branch by giving its name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm run affected:test --base=origin/features/PBI23/MessageHandlers

  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the lib projects have npm versions?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Answer:&lt;/strong&gt; No, because they are not buildable and publishable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How should we branch in monorepo ?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Answer:&lt;/strong&gt; V1, V2, V3 are the branches for the monorepo.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When do we create branches ?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Answer:&lt;/strong&gt; As you move your code to a new environment it is recommended to create a separate branch in monorepo.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

How are you managing dependencies among those projects? Developers might be struggling to manage a large set of GitHub repositories and Business might be spending a lot of money to manage them. The potential solution to this problem is Monorepo. You can put all of your JavaScript projects regardless of framework (angular, vue.js, react.js) in a single GitHub repository called monorepo. This will solve the problem and you will not have many Git projects. However, nothing is free! So there are many challenges with monorepo that developers are facing. I will explain all of the challenges and show you how you can solve them. Also I will create monorepo from scratch in this article using angular projects as samples.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/qxXxmBa.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/qxXxmBa.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption Basics</title><link href="https://www.rupeshtiwari.com/symmetric-and-asymmetric-encryption-basics/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption Basics" /><published>2021-11-19T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-11-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.rupeshtiwari.com/symmetric-and-asymmetric-encryption-basics</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.rupeshtiwari.com/symmetric-and-asymmetric-encryption-basics/">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Why do you care about encryption strategies? Well if you are planning to become system administrator or solution architect then you must know how you would secure your applications deployed on-premise or cloud.  Also remember this question is asked in most of the solution architect interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-you-need-to-encrypt-user-data&quot;&gt;Why do you need to encrypt user data?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose you have a banking website hosted on a server. A user logged in to your application and he is fetching his account details. If the server does not encrypt the data sent over the internet to the user machine then any attacker can sniff the traffic and steal the account information. Also possible some attacker can steal the cookie or session key and authenticate himself as you and start doing transactions on behalf of you called &lt;a href=&quot;https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Session_fixation&quot;&gt;session fixation&lt;/a&gt;. There is also the possibility of cross site scripting (XSS) and cross site request forgery (XSRF) attacks which are in top &lt;a href=&quot;https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/&quot;&gt;10 vulnerability attacks identified by Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP&lt;/a&gt;) if you do not secure your communication between server application and client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8jIjVJJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope no you are convinced that you must learn encryption mechanisms in order to protect your server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-cryptography&quot;&gt;What is cryptography?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cryptography is the study of secure communications techniques that allow only the sender and intended recipient of a message to view its contents. The term is derived from the Greek word kryptos, which means hidden. - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-cryptography&quot;&gt;Cryptography Definitions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-symmetric-encryption&quot;&gt;What is Symmetric Encryption?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the symmetric encryption you use a single key to encrypt and decrypt user data. Both server (sender) and client (receiver) must have the same key in order for sending and receiving data successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/t2Fs7Xa.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security&quot;&gt;TLS/SSL&lt;/a&gt; uses symmetric cryptography using the session key after the initial handshake is done. The most frequently and widely used symmetric encryption algorithms are AES-128, AES-192 and AES-256.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-asymmetric-encryption&quot;&gt;What is Asymmetric encryption?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Asymmetric encryption the sender creates a pair of keys. One is called a public key, another one is a private key. The user data is encrypted by using a private key which can only be decrypted by using the corresponding public key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Pr8xBQv.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLS/SSL uses asymmetric cryptography to initiate the communication which is also known as TLS/SSL handshake. Most widely used asymmetric encryption algorithms are elgamal, RSA, Elliptic curve technique and PKCS.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rupesh Tiwari</name></author><category term="webdev" /><category term="tutorial" /><category term="beginners" /><category term="cloud" /><summary type="html">Why do you care about encryption strategies?

  &lt;p&gt;Did you know By default azure storage accounts are accessible by the public internet. How can u restrict all public traffic in to your azure storage account and only allow your VNet resources to connect it. Lets learn the same in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-access-blob-storage-from-vm-by-minimizing-internet-access&quot;&gt;How to access blob storage from VM by minimizing internet access?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose we have one VM om Azure where we have deployed our web server that is hosting rupeshtiwari.com. Now I want to show some images which I want to bring from my azure Blob storage account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default all of my images in the azure storage account is accessible from internet. Because, Storage account has &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;allow access from all network&lt;/code&gt; as default settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/W7wbOIK.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So question is how can I restrict all internet access to my blob storage and only allow my webserver to communicate to blob storage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Ex7bJAW.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Create Public IP Address (104.41.138.18) and allow only this IP to access blob storage&lt;/strong&gt; and restrict internet access in blob storage. You can do this in the Azure portal by going &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Firewall and Virtual Network&lt;/code&gt; section of blob storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PddFfJo.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5bZIdNp.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Allow outbound traffic from VM to blob storage&lt;/strong&gt; using port 449. I have used NSG rules in my VM where I denied internet access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AT4S4w8.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--success&quot;&gt;🏆 &lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even though we assign public IP to VM and communicate to blob storage. All the traffic from VM to blob storage doesn’t go via internet. It goes via Azure Backbone since they are in the same region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-we-need-virtual-network-service-endpoint&quot;&gt;Why we need Virtual Network Service Endpoint?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This above solution will work but what if you wanted to enable internet outbound from VM. It has security risk therefore, you route all traffic from VM to on-premise Firewall for inspection by enabling &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/forced-tunneling&quot;&gt;Azure Firewall Forced Tunneling&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will un-necessary complexity to our network topology. Traffic has to hop multiple time before they reach to the destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we have to think of different solution. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview&quot;&gt;Service Endpoints&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is made for this kind of situation only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OIlmLEg.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traffic between the subnet and the storage account in the same region they reside in the Azure backbone network. Using Service Endpoint the VM inside subnet can connect to blob storage directly using optimized direct route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-configure-service-endpoint-for-virtual-network&quot;&gt;How to Configure Service Endpoint for Virtual Network?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go to virtual network select Subnet where webserver is residing&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/92M9sNh.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add a service endpoint for the Microsoft/Storage in the subnet of your Virtual Network.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9eEIpsN.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now you can delete public IP address listed in blob storage account.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YeL5c4P.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In blob storage Firewall and Virtual network blade, add existing VNet and the subnet where you webserver resides in.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Bq3yPZU.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-protect-data-ex-filtration&quot;&gt;How to protect data ex-filtration?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Service Endpoint allows VM to send data to any storage account living inside the same region. Therefore, it is quite possible that you can fetch prod data in VM which is in subscription-1 and send the data to DEV storage account which is in subscription-2. It is possible since both prod and dev storage accounts are in same region ( EAST US). This is security risk for your prod data. How do you protect this data ex-filtration?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xkQjbgD.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well you need to add policy in Virtual Network Service Endpoint to restrict outside subscription blob storage account communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;service-endpoint-policies&quot;&gt;Service Endpoint Policies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some malicious employee can send the data from the VM to some other secrete blob storage within same region. How do you prevent this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can limit the storage account that service endpoint has access to it by using &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoint-policies-overview&quot;&gt;service endpoint policies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/SC6kWYt.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can go to service endpoint policies and create new policy, where you can restrict communication within your subscription resources only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HGvPY1j.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you add policy and save it then it is fully secured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WCLZ10p.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;allow-access-to-blob-storage-from-on-premise-or-home-pc&quot;&gt;Allow access to Blob Storage from on-premise or home PC&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do NAT on on-premise and white list one public IP address in your storage account to allow access. However, if you do not want any public IP address access on your storage account then you must use &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview&quot;&gt;Azure Private Endpoint&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What are &lt;strong&gt;Azure Monitor&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Application Insights&lt;/strong&gt;? How exactly Azure Monitor work? How can you visualize Application Map with Application Insights? Learn the log retentions and exports. Learn all of this in this article. Helpful article for &lt;strong&gt;AZ-304&lt;/strong&gt; Exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;types-of-data-to-consider&quot;&gt;Types of Data to consider&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Log&lt;/strong&gt;: web application tracings and logs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;time-series&lt;/strong&gt;: data sensitive to time like performance counter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;raw data&lt;/strong&gt;: un-transformed data which is in raw format received from sources&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aggregated data&lt;/strong&gt;: which has a lot less detail and consists counts, averages and other statistical data that you see in Metric Explorer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debug Snapshots&lt;/strong&gt;: which contains debugging data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/Qej8BE6.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Azure Monitor provides an overview of all the monitoring data available.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is a center monitoring hub for all of the services.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can monitor blow things:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Activity Logs&lt;/strong&gt;: who created the service&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metrics&lt;/strong&gt;: CPU usages of VMs&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Azure Services&lt;/strong&gt;: which queries executed on &lt;strong&gt;Cosmos DB&lt;/strong&gt; or how many users visited to &lt;strong&gt;App Service web app&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can drill down the specific data:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can search data using SQL like query called &lt;strong&gt;Kusto Query Language (KQL)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workbooks&lt;/strong&gt; templates to visualize data as reports or create custom &lt;strong&gt;Workbooks&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insights&lt;/strong&gt; to trace web apps
&lt;strong&gt;Automate alert responses&lt;/strong&gt;: react on a specific data with an alert and take some actions. Example: if 10 HTTP exceptions occurs on web app then create a bug automatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;application-insights&quot;&gt;Application Insights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/z6Hsa09.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use it to monitor web and desktop application&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Monitor and alerts on below things:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Availability&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Performance&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Failures&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Usages: By whom application is used and how it is used.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ping and multi-step test&lt;/strong&gt;: ping your website from multiple locations and test if your application is available to all locations. It alerts if your app is offline.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It sends data to Log Analytics Workspace which is a Data Lake that Azure Monitor uses.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Export Azure Application Insight data to storage account in JSON format to keep for long time. For compliance requirement u can keep it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Application Insights provides your Application Map. It also provides the performance, errors and availability of each components of your application map. You can use this to know which component of your application is un-healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;storing-log-data&quot;&gt;Storing Log data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above data is stored in one or more datastores. Example: In &lt;strong&gt;Log Analytics Workspace&lt;/strong&gt;, this is a &lt;strong&gt;data lake&lt;/strong&gt; that stores data in raw format and translate it into table-like structure that you can query using &lt;strong&gt;Kusto Query Language&lt;/strong&gt; (KQL).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--info&quot;&gt;The data in the Log Analytics Workspace is called &lt;strong&gt;Azure Monitor Logs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other data store is &lt;strong&gt;time series&lt;/strong&gt; datastore. This is optimized to store time based data like &lt;strong&gt;performance counter&lt;/strong&gt; and other metrics that comes in granularity of every second, minute or other granularities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;analyzing-log-data&quot;&gt;Analyzing Log data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Log Analytics&lt;/strong&gt; is a &lt;strong&gt;feature&lt;/strong&gt; of Azure Monitor. Logs can be queried by &lt;strong&gt;Log Analytics&lt;/strong&gt; where Azure Monitor can analyze log data with the Kusto Query Language.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metrics Explorer&lt;/strong&gt; is a different &lt;strong&gt;feature&lt;/strong&gt; of Azure Monitor. Azure Monitor analyzes metrics with the &lt;strong&gt;Metrics Analyzer&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workbooks&lt;/strong&gt; allows you to:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Combine data from various Azure data sources and data types.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Enable at-scale views across multiple resources&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Visualize related data in a single interactive report.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The data can be analyzed and used by &lt;strong&gt;Dashboards, Insights, Alerts&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-retention&quot;&gt;Data Retention&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/data-retention-privacy#how-long-is-the-data-kept&quot;&gt;How long is the data kept&lt;/a&gt;? Data kept longer than 90 days will &lt;a href=&quot;https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/&quot;&gt;incur addition charges&lt;/a&gt;. Data retention for &lt;strong&gt;0 days&lt;/strong&gt; means you want to save the data &lt;strong&gt;forever&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;application-insights-data-retention&quot;&gt;Application Insights Data Retention&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/z6Hsa09.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Application Insights send its data to &lt;strong&gt;Log Analytics Workspace&lt;/strong&gt; which Azure Monitor can use.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Application Insights can store its &lt;strong&gt;raw data&lt;/strong&gt; for up to &lt;strong&gt;730 days (2 Years)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/export-telemetry&quot;&gt;Continuous Export (deprecated)&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Diagnostics Settings&lt;/strong&gt; (current) to store log data in Azure Storage, Event Hub as soon as data arrives. You can export data to Azure storage account with vNet, firewalls and private links.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aggregated data&lt;/strong&gt; is retained at a granularity of &lt;strong&gt;1 minute for 90 days&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debug Snapshots&lt;/strong&gt; are kept for &lt;strong&gt;15 days&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;azure-monitor-logs-retention&quot;&gt;Azure Monitor Logs Retention&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/ZVAHwXf.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The data which is present in the &lt;strong&gt;Azure Analytics Workspace&lt;/strong&gt; can stay up to 730 days. You can choose lower days also.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can &lt;strong&gt;export&lt;/strong&gt; this data to Azure &lt;strong&gt;Storage&lt;/strong&gt; or Azure &lt;strong&gt;Event Hubs&lt;/strong&gt; to be processed by another system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;azure-monitor-metrics-retention&quot;&gt;Azure Monitor Metrics Retention&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/LwjC4Kj.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metrics&lt;/strong&gt; can be stored for max &lt;strong&gt;93 days&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance counters&lt;/strong&gt; collected by &lt;strong&gt;Log Analytics Agents&lt;/strong&gt; which further can be sent to &lt;strong&gt;Log Analytics Workspace&lt;/strong&gt; and because of that it can be stored for &lt;strong&gt;31 days by default to 730 days&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;azure-monitor-agents&quot;&gt;Azure Monitor Agents&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtual machines and other compute resources require an agent to collect monitoring data required to measure the performance and availability of their guest operating system and workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;windows-agents&quot;&gt;Windows Agents&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check the latest Windows agents updates &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview#windows-agents&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/2jUXY9q.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview#windows-agents&quot;&gt;Windows Agents&lt;/a&gt; are small application that collects data and sends to Azure Log Analytics workspace or Metrics Datastore. If you run windows based machine or VM you can install an Azure Monitor agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;linux-agents&quot;&gt;Linux Agents&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When you want to move your business to cloud the major thing to consider is storage. What kind of data you can store? What is the pricing? How can you optimize cost and performance? As a cloud architect its your responsibility to get this answers and propose a design. I will try to help to get the basics of Azure storage account in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-kind-of-data-you-want-to-store-in-cloud&quot;&gt;What kind of data you want to store in Cloud?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Images, Videos, Text Files, binary data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tables&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Files&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Queue&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you need Hard Disk in cloud to mount for your VM ? Disk storage you need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To store above kind of data in Azure you need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal&quot;&gt;create Azure Storage account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;custom-domain-for-azure-storage-account&quot;&gt;Custom Domain for Azure Storage Account&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally Azure storage account creates default endpoint given to you by Azure like: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pricing.blob.core.windows.net&lt;/code&gt;. Azure Storage account is unique per domain. If you have 2 custom domains then you need 2 storage accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;: If you want to create sales.storage.com, pricing.storage.com then for each host name you need 2 new storage accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PlTif5w.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-many-types-of-azure-storage-accounts-are-there&quot;&gt;How many types of Azure Storage Accounts are there?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 2 types of Azure storage accounts: &lt;strong&gt;Standard&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-premium-storage-high-performance-storage-for-azure-virtual-machine-workloads/&quot;&gt;Premium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; based on the performance requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/dNZFT12.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice: while creating storage account you have to choose &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;standard or premium&lt;/code&gt; as per your performance need. Premium accounts are highly performance account with SSD disk and super fast accessible but costly option though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/D6lDVaH.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;standard-storage-account&quot;&gt;Standard Storage Account&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the recommended azure storage account. Azure Standard Account in old days used to be of 3 types (this is legacy now a days)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;General Purpose V1&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;General Purpose V2 and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blob account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jzlsAH1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now a days,in Standard Storage Account we have only one type &lt;strong&gt;General Purpose V2&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QJnAGdy.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;general-purpose-v2-gpv2-storage-account&quot;&gt;General Purpose v2 (GPv2) Storage Account&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the newest storage account. This supports all of the storage services: &lt;strong&gt;Blob, Azure Files, Queue, Page Blob and Disk, and Table&lt;/strong&gt;. It also supports blob tiering. You can select a default hot or cool tier. It supports all kind of redundancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;premium-storage-account&quot;&gt;Premium Storage Account&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Premium accounts are meant for very high performance use case. It has SSD disk and fast random access to file, data etc. Data in premium account can not be automatically transferred to standard account. You have to write backup and upload task to transfer data to other account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Premium account are of &lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt; types: &lt;strong&gt;Block Blobs, File Shares and Page Blobs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/XzwSANB.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Premium account data has 2 types of redundancy strategies: &lt;strong&gt;LRS and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy#zone-redundant-storage&quot;&gt;ZRS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rQJtqCn.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--danger&quot;&gt;🛎️ &lt;strong&gt;Important&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Azure Storage Premium account for &lt;strong&gt;Page blobs&lt;/strong&gt; only supports &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy#locally-redundant-storage&quot;&gt;LRS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Redundancy as on now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all about storage accounts. Next lets learn how data is stored in these storage accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-data-is-stored-in-azure-storage&quot;&gt;How data is stored in Azure Storage?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the data is stored as blobs only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AkpEFeB.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SQL Data stored in Azure SQL Service&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Azure Virtual Disk ( vhd files )&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Image, video, media files&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;log, metrics data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Documents, pdf, text file&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;any unstructured data or binary data&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/SSkSAc4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They all are stored in Azure as blob only. Therefore, we must understand what is blob and how can we create categories of blobs to optimize for certain use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;types-of-blobs&quot;&gt;Types of Blobs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadly there are 2 types of blobs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Block Blobs and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Page Blobs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zG2dD8m.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--success&quot;&gt;🏆 &lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Append Blobs&lt;/strong&gt; are basically block blobs optimized for append operations are heavily used for storing Log data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;block-blobs&quot;&gt;Block Blobs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Image, Video file, Text file, binary data any kind of unstructured data is good for block blobs. Log data must be stored as append blobs only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ideal for storing Text and Binary Data.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gIebE45.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A single block blob can contain up to &lt;strong&gt;50,000&lt;/strong&gt; blocks of up to &lt;strong&gt;100 MB&lt;/strong&gt; each, for a total size of &lt;strong&gt;4.75 TB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zg0lrp4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Append blobs are optimized for append operations (e.g. &lt;strong&gt;logging&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/pCax9mp.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;page-blobs&quot;&gt;Page Blobs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Efficient for read/write operations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Used by Azure VMs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Up to &lt;strong&gt;8 TB&lt;/strong&gt; in size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7XPMHwi.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-azure-page-blobs-are-used-in-real-world&quot;&gt;Where Azure Page Blobs are used in real world?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/managed-disks-overview&quot;&gt;Azure Disks Storage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are persisted in Hyper-V VHD format and stored as a &lt;strong&gt;page blob&lt;/strong&gt; in Azure Storage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Azure SQL DB service&lt;/strong&gt; which currently uses page blobs for storing SQL data, enabling fast random read-write operations for the database.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PaaS service&lt;/strong&gt; for shared media access for collaborative video editing applications, page blobs enable fast access to random locations in the media.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Microsoft services like &lt;strong&gt;Azure Site Recovery, Azure Backup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5swhULh.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;storage-access-tiers&quot;&gt;Storage Access Tiers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to access data you have to pay money. In order to store data also you have to pay money. So if you want to not use some data and just keep for longer time then you must store them as archive in azure storage account. So lets learn what are the access tiers of storage account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 3 tiers that you can store your data in storage account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hot&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cold&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Archive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--danger&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
🛎️ &lt;strong&gt;Important&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Azure premium account doesn’t have access tiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/joqRVMs.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hot-tier&quot;&gt;Hot Tier&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Higher storage costs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lower access costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cold-tier&quot;&gt;Cold Tier&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lower storage costs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Higher access costs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Intended for data that will remain cool for 30 days or more&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you try to access data earlier than 30 days you will have to pay the charges for that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;archive-tier&quot;&gt;Archive Tier&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lowest storage costs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Highest retrieval costs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When a blob is in archive storage it is offline and cannot be read&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have many choice let me help you to understand when to use disk, files or blob storage account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;when-to-use-blobs-storage-account&quot;&gt;When to use Blobs Storage Account?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When your application wants to access data from anywhere.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Large amount of objects, images, videos etc.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Learn about malware, attacks to the network, social engineering attacks from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;malware&quot;&gt;Malware&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malware can be very problematic that can lock access of files and demand money to pay. It happened to many police office. They had to pay Money to the malware software created to get back the access of the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reference: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0bbor_qrUHjy81QzEs0n63duuhQUdr8W&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 Main areas of Malware are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nuisance&lt;/strong&gt;
Adds, Spyware and Marketing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remote Access / Keyloggers&lt;/strong&gt; : Get in to our system and steal password&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remote Attacks / DDos&lt;/strong&gt;: Use our machine as a botnet and do remote attack against some 3rd party application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;adware&quot;&gt;Adware&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malware that is installed on an infected machine to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;deliver ads&lt;/code&gt;. Use Malwarebytes Anti-Malware software to prevent Adware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;virus&quot;&gt;Virus&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malicious code that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;require user interaction&lt;/code&gt; to install and replicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spyware&quot;&gt;Spyware&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malicious software that capture &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;user activity&lt;/code&gt; and reports back. ( keystrokes, web browsing activity etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trojan&quot;&gt;Trojan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seemingly friendly software that contains &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;hidden&lt;/code&gt; malicious software. Normally, it comes from Remote Access Tools (RAT).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rootkits&quot;&gt;Rootkits&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malicious code that install itself at the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;OS or Kernel&lt;/code&gt; level to avoid detection. They load before OS load while bootup. So anti-virus can not detect it. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Kasper Sky Lab&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;TDSSKiller&lt;/code&gt; it can scan boot sector, services and drivers. It is free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ClM2vva.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;backdoor&quot;&gt;Backdoor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software that installs for the purpose of opening ports and installing &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;additional software&lt;/code&gt;. Backdoor can steal passwords. Full access to the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;logic-bomb&quot;&gt;Logic Bomb&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malicious code that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;triggers&lt;/code&gt; after a period of time based on some &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;date&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;specific activity&lt;/code&gt;. Normally in backup files or codes they hide. An employee who wants to destroy company by installing logic bomb that triggers after he gets fired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZAYA7Ki.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;botnet&quot;&gt;Botnet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malicious code that infects &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;large numbers&lt;/code&gt; of hosts for the purpose of launching &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;large scale attacks&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;specific targets&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A botnet refers to a group of computers which have been infected by malware and have come under the control of a malicious actor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PWszcsh.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Command and Control (C&amp;amp;C) servers can control thousands of bots( zombies ) for massive DDoS attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can target Military, Google, Amazon, Yahoo etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ransomware&quot;&gt;Ransomware&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malicious applications that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scare&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scam&lt;/code&gt; users into taking some type of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;action&lt;/code&gt;. Typically paying the creator for removal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/VJHY1wO.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;polymorphic-malware&quot;&gt;Polymorphic Malware&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malware that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;changes&lt;/code&gt; on each install to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;avoid detection&lt;/code&gt; like changing ports, destination IP addresses etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;armored-virus&quot;&gt;Armored Virus&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malicious code that is designed to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;avoid&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;detection&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;analysis&lt;/code&gt; ( Encryption, obfuscation, additional useless code, etc. )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;types-of-attacks-to-the-network&quot;&gt;Types of Attacks to the Network&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 Categories of attacks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Denial of Service: DDoS&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;NMap software if u give ip address of router then it will give all details of your machine.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qfZIHm4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pharming&lt;/strong&gt;: Redirecting a website’s traffic somewhere else.&lt;br /&gt;
If attacker modify DNS Server to redirect the site to Hacker server. Also called as &lt;strong&gt;DNS Poising and ARP Poising&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9GZrPM7.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If attacker modify Client PC to redirect the site to Hacker server.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transitive Access&lt;/strong&gt;: Hard to guard this one. Granted by virtue of being granted access to intermediatory component. If A trusts B and B trusts C then A trusts C by nature of transitivity.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5btQMN3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Client-Side attacks&lt;/strong&gt;: Attack initiated by client machine. Firewall can not guard against this attack. Layered defences can only save us from client-side attacks. Something like WAF web application firewall on the PC and stop this attack.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Fj4nJE4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Brute Force: keep trying the password till you crack.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Dictionary Attacks: use tools like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Crack&lt;/code&gt; to get possible password.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Hybrid: brute force attack combined with dictionary attack.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Birthday Attacks: Try all combination of alphanumeric value to get the hash value that match with user’s password hash value.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Pf3iB2g.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Rainbow Tables: Precomputed cryptographic hash that gives you large list of hashes to try.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Typo Squatting/URL Hijacking: Hackers register domain names with wrong spelling and fool user. Example: Google, Googel, Googgle etc. They just get tons of traffic and they can route them to other site and earn money from them.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Watering Hole Attack: Attackers plant malware on the Less secure website where user of targeted company frequently go.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;man-in-middle&quot;&gt;Man In Middle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hacker can use Packet sniffing software (WIRESHARK) to intrude the connection. Get the sender and receiver server information. He can get access to the website as Alice or Bob.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ihAimsY.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; {: .full}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;replay&quot;&gt;Replay&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sniffing the wired network. Capture packet and put them back in the connection in the network. If you don’t get packet on sequence or delay then it is an alert for replay or man in middle attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wYC6XXI.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ddos&quot;&gt;DDoS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wifi-scams&quot;&gt;Wifi Scams&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rogue access points: Hacker put their WAP and do malicious activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8h8uCeC.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;War Driving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BikLpVp.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Bluesnarfing: Get data from someone’s phone&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;IV attacks: Initialization Vector Attacks. Hackers can easily cracked encryptions WEP 24 bit encryption data.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Packet Sniffing: Someone can use tools (like &lt;strong&gt;WIRESHARK&lt;/strong&gt;) to read data from the network’s packets. You can look source, destination, protocol, and the actual query, data etc.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4YBw1Va.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WEP/WPA attacks&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0E3Y1WB.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;application-attacks&quot;&gt;Application Attacks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cross-site scripting (XSS): technique to hijack sessions. Browser will run the malicious code because it was served from the server it trust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/SikAW63.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9b1WDBm.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cross-site Request Forgery (XSRF)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hacker can manipulate the header of the packet. Here server will run the malicious code because it trust the client. You can use VPN or SSL/TLS to prevent XSRF attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ynY2Xgu.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;XSS vs XSRF&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Lg8RhYP.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SQL injection&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add malicious sql code into the data stream that is running on SQL server. Throw error to crash app, or get info about tables in SQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;LDAP injection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LDAP is used to authenticate users. Pass a malicious LDAP query to the webserver that will execute in LDAP server and return additional data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, sanitize the input value coming from client in webserver before executing to protect this attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;XML injection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inject xml query to alter the path or query of resource. Make a $harmless query in the .ini file present in the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;security-assessment-tools&quot;&gt;Security Assessment Tools&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the tools produce lot of results. How to interpreted the data produced by these tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Protocol Analyzer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vulnerability Scanner&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Honeypots&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Honeynets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Port Scanner&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Passive vs. Active Tools&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Banner Grabbing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;protocol-analyzer&quot;&gt;Protocol Analyzer&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is known as packet sniffer. It can get layer-2,3 information. Capture package you can save it or analyze it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wireshark&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Netmon (Microsoft)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Retina&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Igxxezh.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vulnerability-scanner&quot;&gt;Vulnerability Scanner&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scan entire network, segment of network or specific host.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nmap&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nessus&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Retina&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SAINT&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;honeypots--honeynets&quot;&gt;Honeypots &amp;amp; Honeynets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You create a trap for hacker and let them do their business. Meanwhile you can identify them learn hacker’s techniques, tools etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QxhNDxR.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;port-scanner&quot;&gt;Port Scanner&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NMap&lt;/strong&gt; is a port scanner tool, it can search for open ports. There are &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;65,536&lt;/code&gt; ports available.
Common ports are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;HTTP = 80&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;FTP = 21 and 22&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SMTP = 58&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SMTP = 25&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DNS = 53&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SSL = 443&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;banner-grabbing&quot;&gt;Banner Grabbing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Telnet&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Netcat&lt;/strong&gt; are used to know what services are running on the specific ports. Hacker can crack that specific service or application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;passive-vs-active-tools&quot;&gt;Passive vs. Active Tools&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passive Tools: Don’t interact directly with host, just monitor traffic and see what host is doing.
Active Tools: It is visible to the host and admin. Here you interact with host and get info out of the host. ( Honeypots/honeynets, Port scanner, banner grabbing, penetration testing)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QPvmzx7.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;risk-assessment-tools&quot;&gt;Risk Assessment Tools&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Threat vs Likelihood. Business owner has to find out the risk of tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;AV = Asset Value&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;EF = Exposure Factor&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ALE ( Annual Loss Expectancy ) : How much monitory loss u can expect in a year. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ALE = SLE x ARO&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SLE ( Single Loss Expectancy ) : How much monitory loss u can expect at anytime. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SLE = AV x EF&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ARO ( Annualized Rate of Occurrence ) : Probability of the server failure during the year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example:
If your business Annual Loss = 121K , Fixing cost = 500K Would you do fix or bear loss? For Amazon they will fix it because they are obsessed of customer and you care for them and don’t let your business down that will impact your customer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Determine attack surface&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Review Architecture&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Review Design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;determine-attack-surface&quot;&gt;Determine attack surface&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) has the goal of mitigating risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;penetration-testing-vs-vulnerability-scanning&quot;&gt;Penetration testing vs Vulnerability Scanning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Penetration Testing&lt;/strong&gt; (Pen Testing): Attacking a computer system with the intention of finding it’s weaknesses and security vulnerability. This is a intrusive test. &lt;strong&gt;So business has to sign off&lt;/strong&gt; for penetration testing. It could bring servers down and business may be impacted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;penetration-testing&quot;&gt;Penetration testing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bypass security control
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;XSS attacks&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;IP or MAC Spoofing : Check switch are only allowing few IP’s.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;MiTM attacks&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Protocol Analyzer or Packet Sniffers&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Actively Test security controls
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This is a intrusive test. So business has to sign off for this test. It could bring servers down and business may be impacted.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Exploiting Vulnerabilities
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nessus&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Metasploit&lt;/strong&gt; tool can be used to find missing patches and security misconfigurations.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vulnerability-scanning&quot;&gt;Vulnerability Scanning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a non-intrusive testing and it does not impact business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;intrusive-vs-non-intrusive-security-testing&quot;&gt;Intrusive vs Non-intrusive Security Testing&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;False Positive&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Black Box
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;tester has no prior knowledge of network or environment.
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;use fuzzing technique&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;use injection attack&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;White Box
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;full knowledge of network or environment&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;done by internal employee&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Grey Box
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;some knowledge, no access of documents, but they know where to go and test&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-to-remember&quot;&gt;Things to Remember&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take Business consent for Vulnerability or Penetrating Testing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Review company &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;guidelines and rules of engagement&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure You have skills and background to do Pen testing. This is very expensive test. If you make mistake and did detail testing or deep scan it will shut down network and environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Below are the &lt;strong&gt;services&lt;/strong&gt; to Monitor your applications:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Application-level&lt;/strong&gt; monitoring services:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Application Insights&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;App Center&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subscription / resource group / virtual network level&lt;/strong&gt; monitoring services:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Network Watcher&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Azure Monitor&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Azure Monitor is the central service that can help you to improve performance of your application and dependencies. In this article I will go through the basic knowledge about Azure Monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FOQXz3R.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;azure-monitor-overview&quot;&gt;Azure Monitor Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Azure Monitor&lt;/strong&gt; Is a &lt;strong&gt;service&lt;/strong&gt; in the cloud and has &lt;strong&gt;features&lt;/strong&gt; like &lt;strong&gt;Application Insights&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FFPq95S.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It helps you &lt;strong&gt;maximize&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;strong&gt;availability and performance&lt;/strong&gt; of your &lt;strong&gt;applications&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;services&lt;/strong&gt; by collecting, analyzing and acting on telemetry from cloud and on-premises environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HWvAQWK.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It collects log, telemetry, metrics data from cloud and on-premises resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fpoWLBp.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You already are using Azure Monitor when you create any &lt;strong&gt;resource&lt;/strong&gt; in Azure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;: When you created a static site in your storage account. Azure monitor will automatically collect performance metrics information and start showing metrics to you. You can access and visualize it’s metrics how many request and response your site is handling from the resource it self by going to the Azure portal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/njxry7F.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;: Logs are collected by Azure Monitor to show the activity within your subscription.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fjy5UJE.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;azure-monitor-data-gathering&quot;&gt;Azure Monitor Data Gathering&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure Monitor Collects Data from 3 places: Azure platform services, Infrastructure, Applications into Metrics or Log. Performance Metrics are stored in &lt;strong&gt;Time Series Database (TSDB)&lt;/strong&gt; and Logs are stored in Azure &lt;strong&gt;Log Analytics Workspace&lt;/strong&gt; inside a table called as &lt;strong&gt;AzureActivity&lt;/strong&gt;. Log Analytics Workspace is nothing but a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction&quot;&gt;Azure Data Lake&lt;/a&gt; built on Azure Blob Storage Account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bRC0GHh.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;azure-platform-services&quot;&gt;Azure Platform Services&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EKVan5V.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sign On Information from &lt;strong&gt;Azure AD Audit Logs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Activity Logs&lt;/strong&gt; for service health and configuration changes of resources&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resource Log&lt;/strong&gt; and Platform metrics which provides details to the operations performance of each resource.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;infrastructure&quot;&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sZiz4yS.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compute Resources&lt;/strong&gt; like VMs requires an agent to collect log and performance data from Guest OS workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These VMs can be in on-premise, Azure or in other cloud ( AWS , Google Cloud )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;applications&quot;&gt;Applications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sZiz4yS.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For application use &lt;strong&gt;Application Insight&lt;/strong&gt; to collect detail Metrics and logs related to the performance of the applications written in any language and any environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;custom-sources&quot;&gt;Custom Sources&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure Monitor has also API to collect data from any places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;azure-monitor-features-to-analyze-and-act-on-data&quot;&gt;Azure Monitor Features to Analyze and Act on Data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visualize&lt;/strong&gt; the data using &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/azure-portal-dashboards&quot;&gt;Dashboards&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview&quot;&gt;Workbooks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analyze&lt;/strong&gt; the data using &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-getting-started&quot;&gt;Metrics Explorer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-tutorial&quot;&gt;Log Analytics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Respond&lt;/strong&gt; Azure Monitor can pro-actively &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-overview&quot;&gt;alert&lt;/a&gt; you when a metric value or the result of the log query indicate a problem or based on custom conditions and it can take some automated &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/action-groups&quot;&gt;actions&lt;/a&gt; like sending email or running some azure functions or Logic Apps. If metric values indicate load is increasing in VMs or any resource then you can use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[AutoScale](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/autoscale/autoscale-overview)&lt;/code&gt; feature to automatically add or remove compute resources.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insights&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview&quot;&gt;Application Insight&lt;/a&gt; identifies exceptions thorough all of the components of your applications. Insights are available for &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-overview&quot;&gt;Container&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/vm/vminsights-overview&quot;&gt;VM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/insights/network-insights-overview&quot;&gt;Network&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-insights-overview&quot;&gt;Storage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/insights/solutions?tabs=portal&quot;&gt;Additional Solutions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-tool-integrations&quot;&gt;Other Tool Integrations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have &lt;a href=&quot;#siem&quot;&gt;SIEM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;#itsm&quot;&gt;ITSM&lt;/a&gt; tools that require access to the data that it collects. How would you give Azure Monitor Data to other tools? You can send the log and metrics to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-about&quot;&gt;Azure Event Hub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to make it accessible outside of Azure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/GWDAQ5k.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;itsm&quot;&gt;ITSM&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IT Service Management (ITSM) Few ITSM tools are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.servicenow.com/&quot;&gt;ServiceNow&lt;/a&gt;, System Center Service Manager, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.provance.com/&quot;&gt;Provance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cherwell.com/services/training/&quot;&gt;Cherwell&lt;/a&gt;. You can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/itsmc-overview&quot;&gt;IT Service Management Connector&lt;/a&gt; in Azure to connect your own ITSM tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;siem&quot;&gt;SIEM&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security Incident and Event Monitoring (SIEM) - Microsoft Azure Sentinel is a scalable, cloud-native, security information event management (SIEM) and security orchestration automated response (SOAR) solution.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When I started learning Azure being a webdev and software architect background. I came across many IT lingo, jargons, abbrebiations that I did know about them. In this post I am putting all those in one place. I hope this will help you as well on your Azure Solution Architect journey!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;radius&quot;&gt;RADIUS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) is a networking protocol that provides centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting management for users who connect and use a network service. RADIUS was developed by Livingston Enterprises in 1991 as an access server authentication and accounting protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;eapol&quot;&gt;EAPOL&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extensible Authentication Access Protocol over LAN&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mac&quot;&gt;MAC&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Media Access Control Address: It uniquely identifies the device in the network. 48-bit hexadecimal number that is hard-coded on a NIC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;roi&quot;&gt;ROI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Return on Investment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;isv&quot;&gt;ISV&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;independent software vendor&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;san&quot;&gt;SAN&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN: &lt;a href=&quot;httpss://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/azure/migrate/prepare-for-migration#configure-san-policy&quot;&gt;storage area network (SAN) &lt;/a&gt;
By default, Azure VMs are assigned drive D to use as temporary storage&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This drive assignment causes all other attached storage drive assignments to increment by one letter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For example, if your on-premises installation uses a data disk that is assigned to drive D for application installations, the assignment for this drive increments to drive E after you migrate the VM to Azure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To prevent this automatic assignment, and to ensure that Azure assigns the next free drive letter to its temporary volume, set the storage area network (SAN) policy to &lt;strong&gt;OnlineAll&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;arr&quot;&gt;ARR&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Application Request Routing (ARR)&lt;/strong&gt; is a feature where when a client (or browser) request to any Azure based website, a cookie will be created and stick to the first time request received web site instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pip&quot;&gt;PIP&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A virtual machine running in Azure can now be associated with a direct and publicly accessible IP address that sticks to the VM for its lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nsg&quot;&gt;NSG&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;network security group (NSG)&lt;/strong&gt; contains a list of security rules that allow or deny network traffic to resources connected to Azure Virtual Networks (VNet). NSGs can be associated to subnets or individual network interfaces (NIC) attached to VMs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nic&quot;&gt;NIC&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;httpss://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-network-interface&quot;&gt;Network Interface (NIC)&lt;/a&gt; enables an Azure Virtual Machine to communicate with internet, Azure, and on-premises resources. When creating a virtual machine using the Azure portal, the portal creates one network interface with default settings for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rbac&quot;&gt;RBAC&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role-based access control (RBAC)&lt;/strong&gt; is a policy-neutral access-control mechanism defined around roles and privileges. The components of RBAC such as role-permissions, user-role and role-role relationships make it simple to perform user assignments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cmdb&quot;&gt;CMDB&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Configuration Management Database&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rack&quot;&gt;Rack&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Rack has servers (Virtual Machines) in a data-center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sku&quot;&gt;SKU&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) Learn more about &lt;a href=&quot;httpss://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/compute/resourceskus/list&quot;&gt;SKU types in Azure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hpc&quot;&gt;HPC&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/topics/high-performance-computing&quot;&gt;High performance Computing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;beegfs&quot;&gt;BeeGFS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(formerly FhGFS) is a parallel file system, developed and optimized for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeeGFS&quot;&gt;high-performance computing&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Beegfs-architecture-overview.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pbs&quot;&gt;PBS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;telnet&quot;&gt;Telnet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teletype Network (Telnet) developed in 1969. Plain text communication between machines. Good for LAN since data in not encrypted. Not good for sensitive data. It works on applciation layer (layer-7) of OSI model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;snat&quot;&gt;SNAT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) allows traffic from a private network to go out to the internet. Virtual machines launched on a private network can get to the internet by going through a gateway capable of performing SNAT. The device performing NAT changes the private IP address of the source host to public IP address.&lt;/p&gt;

You’ll often hear RAID as it relates to network attached storage or “NAS”. You know in movies when you see the “mainframe” and it’s rows and rows of hard drives backing up all of the evil corporation’s information? That’s NAS, and that’s RAID in action. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID&quot;&gt;RAID Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;protocol&quot;&gt;Protocol&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In networking, a &lt;strong&gt;protocol&lt;/strong&gt; is a specified way of formatting data so that any networked computer can interpret the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protocols and their ports:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;HTTP = 80&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;FTP = 21 and 22&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SMTP = 58&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SMTP = 25&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DNS = 53&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SSL = 443&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;udp&quot;&gt;UDP&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Datagram Protocol (UDP)&lt;/strong&gt; is a connection-less transportation protocol. UDP is used to pass the actual user data. Communication is datagram oriented, so the integrity is guaranteed only on the single datagram. Datagrams reach destination and can arrive out of order or don’t arrive at all. It’s generally used for real time communication, where a little percentage of packet loss rate is preferable to the overhead of a TCP connection. It is an Transport layer (layer-4) protocol. UDP, the User Datagram Protocol, does not set up these dedicated connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tcp&quot;&gt;TCP&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)&lt;/strong&gt; TCP is a connection oriented transportation protocol. TCP is used to pass the actual user data. It guarantees that all sent packets will reach the destination in the correct order. TCP, the Transmission Control Protocol, sets up dedicated connections between devices and ensures that all packets arrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ssl&quot;&gt;SSL&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) now it is deprecated. It is session layer protocol. It is presentation and session layer protocol. It lies between Transport and application layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hlsEVeJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tls&quot;&gt;TLS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transport Layer Security (TLS) provides communications security over a computer network. It is presentation and session layer protocol. It lies between Transport and application layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hlsEVeJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ip&quot;&gt;IP&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet Protocol (IP)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ipsec&quot;&gt;IPSec&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet Protocol Security (IPSec): IPsec is a group of protocols that are used together to set up encrypted connections between devices. IPsec is often used to set up VPNs, and it works by encrypting IP packets, along with authenticating the source where the packets come from. IPsec uses UDP because this allows IPsec packets to get through firewalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IPsec is not one protocol, but a suite of protocols. Internet Protocol (IP) is not part of the IPsec suite, IPsec runs directly on top of IP. The following protocols make up the IPsec suite:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authentication Header (AH):&lt;/strong&gt; The AH protocol ensures that data packets are from a trusted source and that the data has not been tampered with, like a tamper-proof seal on a consumer product. These headers do not provide any encryption; they do not help conceal the data from attackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encapsulating Security Protocol (ESP):&lt;/strong&gt; ESP encrypts the IP header and the payload for each packet — unless transport mode is used, in which case it only encrypts the payload. ESP adds its own header and a trailer to each data packet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security Association (SA):&lt;/strong&gt; SA refers to a number of protocols used for negotiating encryption keys and algorithms. One of the most common SA protocols is Internet Key Exchange (IKE).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reference: https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-ipsec/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;packet&quot;&gt;Packet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All data sent over a network is broken up into smaller pieces called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-gre-tunneling/&quot;&gt;packets&lt;/a&gt;, and all packets have two parts: the payload and the header. The payload is the packet’s actual contents, the data being sent. The header has information about where the packet comes from and what group of packets it belongs to. Each network protocol attaches a header to each packet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tunelling&quot;&gt;Tunelling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encapsulating packets within other packets is called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-gre-tunneling/&quot;&gt;tunneling&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand why this is called “tunneling,” we can change the analogy slightly. If a car needs to pass from Point A on one side of a mountain to Point B on the other side, the most efficient way is to simply go through the mountain. However, ordinary cars are not capable of going straight through solid rock. As a result, the car has to drive all the way around the mountain to get from Point A to Point B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But imagine that a tunnel was created through the mountain. Now, the car can drive straight from Point A to Point B, which is much faster, and which it could not do without the tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gre&quot;&gt;GRE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generic Routing Encapsulation, or GRE, is a protocol for encapsulating data packets that use one routing protocol inside the packets of another protocol. “Encapsulating” means wrapping one data packet within another data packet, like putting a box inside another box. To understand how this works, think about the difference between a car and a ferry. A car travels over roads on land, while a ferry travels over water. A car cannot normally travel on water — however, a car can be loaded onto a ferry in order to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a networking protocol for clock synchronization between computer systems over packet-switched, variable-latency data networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tds&quot;&gt;TDS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tabular Data Stream (TDS) Protocol is an application-level protocol used for the transfer of requests and responses between clients and database server systems. a TDS session is established when the transport-level connection is established and the server receives a request to establish a TDS connection. It persists until the transport-level connection is terminated (for example, when a TCP socket is closed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN: &lt;a href=&quot;httpss://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/azure/migrate/prepare-for-migration#configure-san-policy&quot;&gt;storage area network (SAN) &lt;/a&gt;
By default, Azure VMs are assigned drive D to use as temporary storage&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This drive assignment causes all other attached storage drive assignments to increment by one letter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For example, if your on-premises installation uses a data disk that is assigned to drive D for application installations, the assignment for this drive increments to drive E after you migrate the VM to Azure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To prevent this automatic assignment, and to ensure that Azure assigns the next free drive letter to its temporary volume, set the storage area network (SAN) policy to &lt;strong&gt;OnlineAll&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;telnet&quot;&gt;Telnet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teletype Network (Telnet) developed in 1969. Plain text communication between machines. Good for LAN since data in not encrypted. Not good for sensitive data. It works on applciation layer (layer-7) of OSI model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;snat&quot;&gt;SNAT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) allows traffic from a private network to go out to the internet. Virtual machines launched on a private network can get to the internet by going through a gateway capable of performing SNAT. The device performing NAT changes the private IP address of the source host to public IP address.&lt;/p&gt;

You’ll often hear RAID as it relates to network attached storage or “NAS”. You know in movies when you see the “mainframe” and it’s rows and rows of hard drives backing up all of the evil corporation’s information? That’s NAS, and that’s RAID in action. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID&quot;&gt;RAID Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Bottom Up: &lt;strong&gt;Please Do Not Through Sausage Pizza Away&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;protocol&quot;&gt;Protocol&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In networking, a &lt;strong&gt;protocol&lt;/strong&gt; is a specified way of formatting data so that any networked computer can interpret the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protocols and their ports:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;HTTP = 80&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;FTP = 21 and 22&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SMTP = 58&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SMTP = 25&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DNS = 53&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SSL = 443&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;udp&quot;&gt;UDP&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Datagram Protocol (UDP)&lt;/strong&gt; is a connection-less transportation protocol. UDP is used to pass the actual user data. Communication is datagram oriented, so the integrity is guaranteed only on the single datagram. Datagrams reach destination and can arrive out of order or don’t arrive at all. It’s generally used for real time communication, where a little percentage of packet loss rate is preferable to the overhead of a TCP connection. It is an Transport layer (layer-4) protocol. UDP, the User Datagram Protocol, does not set up these dedicated connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tcp&quot;&gt;TCP&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)&lt;/strong&gt; TCP is a connection oriented transportation protocol. TCP is used to pass the actual user data. It guarantees that all sent packets will reach the destination in the correct order. TCP, the Transmission Control Protocol, sets up dedicated connections between devices and ensures that all packets arrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ssl&quot;&gt;SSL&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) now it is deprecated. It is session layer protocol. It is presentation and session layer protocol. It lies between Transport and application layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hlsEVeJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tls&quot;&gt;TLS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transport Layer Security (TLS) provides communications security over a computer network. It is presentation and session layer protocol. It lies between Transport and application layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hlsEVeJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ip&quot;&gt;IP&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet Protocol (IP)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ipsec&quot;&gt;IPSec&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet Protocol Security (IPSec): IPsec is a group of protocols that are used together to set up encrypted connections between devices. IPsec is often used to set up VPNs, and it works by encrypting IP packets, along with authenticating the source where the packets come from. IPsec uses UDP because this allows IPsec packets to get through firewalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IPsec is not one protocol, but a suite of protocols. Internet Protocol (IP) is not part of the IPsec suite, IPsec runs directly on top of IP. The following protocols make up the IPsec suite:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authentication Header (AH):&lt;/strong&gt; The AH protocol ensures that data packets are from a trusted source and that the data has not been tampered with, like a tamper-proof seal on a consumer product. These headers do not provide any encryption; they do not help conceal the data from attackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encapsulating Security Protocol (ESP):&lt;/strong&gt; ESP encrypts the IP header and the payload for each packet — unless transport mode is used, in which case it only encrypts the payload. ESP adds its own header and a trailer to each data packet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security Association (SA):&lt;/strong&gt; SA refers to a number of protocols used for negotiating encryption keys and algorithms. One of the most common SA protocols is Internet Key Exchange (IKE).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reference: https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-ipsec/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;packet&quot;&gt;Packet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All data sent over a network is broken up into smaller pieces called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-gre-tunneling/&quot;&gt;packets&lt;/a&gt;, and all packets have two parts: the payload and the header. The payload is the packet’s actual contents, the data being sent. The header has information about where the packet comes from and what group of packets it belongs to. Each network protocol attaches a header to each packet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tunelling&quot;&gt;Tunelling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encapsulating packets within other packets is called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-gre-tunneling/&quot;&gt;tunneling&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand why this is called “tunneling,” we can change the analogy slightly. If a car needs to pass from Point A on one side of a mountain to Point B on the other side, the most efficient way is to simply go through the mountain. However, ordinary cars are not capable of going straight through solid rock. As a result, the car has to drive all the way around the mountain to get from Point A to Point B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But imagine that a tunnel was created through the mountain. Now, the car can drive straight from Point A to Point B, which is much faster, and which it could not do without the tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gre&quot;&gt;GRE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generic Routing Encapsulation, or GRE, is a protocol for encapsulating data packets that use one routing protocol inside the packets of another protocol. “Encapsulating” means wrapping one data packet within another data packet, like putting a box inside another box. To understand how this works, think about the difference between a car and a ferry. A car travels over roads on land, while a ferry travels over water. A car cannot normally travel on water — however, a car can be loaded onto a ferry in order to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reference: https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-gre-tunneling/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tds&quot;&gt;TDS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tabular Data Stream (TDS) Protocol is an application-level protocol used for the transfer of requests and responses between clients and database server systems. a TDS session is established when the transport-level connection is established and the server receives a request to establish a TDS connection. It persists until the transport-level connection is terminated (for example, when a TCP socket is closed).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blob Storage&lt;/strong&gt; is helpful to upload images, videos, documents, pdfs etc. over the Azure cloud. In order to create new &lt;strong&gt;Azure Blob Storage&lt;/strong&gt;. You must need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://rupeshtiwari.com/creating-azure-storage-account/&quot;&gt;create Azure Storage Account&lt;/a&gt;. Azure &lt;strong&gt;Blob Storage&lt;/strong&gt; is one of the core &lt;strong&gt;services&lt;/strong&gt; of the &lt;strong&gt;Azure Storage Account&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prerequisite-&quot;&gt;Prerequisite 👍&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--warning&quot;&gt;You must have below things ready before creating Azure Blob storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Azure Account&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Azure Storage Account: &lt;a href=&quot;https://rupeshtiwari.com/creating-azure-storage-account/&quot;&gt;Learn how to create Azure Storage account here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction-&quot;&gt;Introduction 💁&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;settings&quot;&gt;Settings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/gF3vlzs.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storage Account has lots of settings related to implementing &lt;strong&gt;security and network access&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;blob-service&quot;&gt;Blob Service&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/obyeeF0.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-container-&quot;&gt;New Container 🥃&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/o9iFCPL.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to create &lt;strong&gt;at-least one container&lt;/strong&gt; for uploading a file. While Creating Container you must give &lt;strong&gt;name&lt;/strong&gt; and setup &lt;strong&gt;public access level&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;public-access-level&quot;&gt;Public Access Level&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/nPq95hH.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Weather&lt;/strong&gt; the blobs are &lt;strong&gt;accessible&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;anonymous&lt;/strong&gt; or not. While &lt;a href=&quot;https://rupeshtiwari.com/creating-azure-storage-account/&quot;&gt;creating storage account&lt;/a&gt; if you turn off the public access at &lt;strong&gt;account&lt;/strong&gt; level then that settings will &lt;strong&gt;override&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;strong&gt;container public access&lt;/strong&gt; level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;private&quot;&gt;Private&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Default settings is private. That means &lt;strong&gt;authentication&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;required&lt;/strong&gt; either accessing via &lt;strong&gt;browsers&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;REST APIs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;blob&quot;&gt;Blob&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is anonymous read access for blobs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;container&quot;&gt;Container&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is anonymous read access for both containers and blobs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;advanced&quot;&gt;Advanced&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/tcH2EAS.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can choose to &lt;strong&gt;encrypt&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;strong&gt;data&lt;/strong&gt; using the &lt;strong&gt;default&lt;/strong&gt; which is the &lt;strong&gt;encryption key&lt;/strong&gt; for the &lt;strong&gt;storage account&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;encryption-scope&quot;&gt;Encryption Scope&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or use the encryption scope just for &lt;strong&gt;this container data&lt;/strong&gt; that encryption key can be managed by &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft&lt;/strong&gt; or you can use &lt;strong&gt;your own key&lt;/strong&gt; stored in the &lt;strong&gt;Azure Key Vault&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;uploading-blobs-&quot;&gt;Uploading blobs 🥙&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/mKrL90l.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any type of the files can be uploaded from your computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;advanced-1&quot;&gt;Advanced&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;authentication-type&quot;&gt;Authentication type&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/VJ39N4H.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should authenticate using an &lt;strong&gt;Account key&lt;/strong&gt; or using &lt;strong&gt;role in Azure AD user account&lt;/strong&gt;. The recommended one is Azure AD account key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;blob-type&quot;&gt;Blob type&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/ck7W2jk.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;block-blob&quot;&gt;Block blob&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Block blob is the default blob type. While uploading blobs are &lt;strong&gt;broken down&lt;/strong&gt; in to &lt;strong&gt;smaller unit&lt;/strong&gt; that are called &lt;strong&gt;blocks&lt;/strong&gt;. Since blocks are smaller units you get some benefits listed below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;upload &lt;strong&gt;speed&lt;/strong&gt; can become faster&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;upload works on &lt;strong&gt;low bandwidth&lt;/strong&gt; internet connection&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;parallelly&lt;/strong&gt; blocks can be &lt;strong&gt;uploaded&lt;/strong&gt; while uploading blob from user machine to Azure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once upload is done then Azure will &lt;strong&gt;assemble&lt;/strong&gt; them to make a &lt;strong&gt;final blob&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;page-blob&quot;&gt;Page blob&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;page blob is a &lt;strong&gt;collection&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;512 byte&lt;/strong&gt; pages.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;good for &lt;strong&gt;random read or write&lt;/strong&gt; operations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;add&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;update&lt;/strong&gt; content happens by &lt;strong&gt;writing&lt;/strong&gt; page blobs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Azure infrastructure &lt;strong&gt;VMs disk&lt;/strong&gt; are using &lt;strong&gt;page file&lt;/strong&gt; as the foundation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Example: &lt;strong&gt;large&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;video&lt;/code&gt; files, or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.vhd&lt;/code&gt; (disk for virtual machines) files should be uploaded as page blob.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/HY8KqkF.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;append-blob&quot;&gt;Append blob&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Append blob is also &lt;strong&gt;composed&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;blocks&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;However, these blocks are optimized to only &lt;strong&gt;append(add) at the end of the blob&lt;/strong&gt; while assembling.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Delete&lt;/strong&gt; existing &lt;strong&gt;blocks&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; supported when you choose append blob.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Example: &lt;strong&gt;Log files&lt;/strong&gt; must be stored as append blob.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;block-size&quot;&gt;Block size&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you can choose the block size from &lt;strong&gt;64 KB to 100 MB&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;access-tier&quot;&gt;Access tier&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/49K6BaF.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can select your blob access tier while uploading blob. &lt;strong&gt;Hot&lt;/strong&gt; tier is the &lt;strong&gt;default&lt;/strong&gt; one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;upload-to-a-folder&quot;&gt;Upload to a folder&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will put the folder name on the path of the blob path. It will be the real folder if you select &lt;a href=&quot;https://rupeshtiwari.com/creating-azure-storage-account/#hierarchical-namespace&quot;&gt;hierarchical namespace while creating your azure account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;encryption-scope-1&quot;&gt;Encryption scope&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/ZKC3yBP.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;blob-properties-&quot;&gt;Blob properties 🦜&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/sfrJLv6.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
After uploading blob you can see the properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you can overview the details of the blob and check all metadata keys and add more metadata keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;versions&quot;&gt;Versions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you turned on versioning then you can see the versions here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;edit&quot;&gt;Edit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the files like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.txt&lt;/code&gt; can be edited right in the azure portal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;snapshots&quot;&gt;Snapshots&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can create a &lt;strong&gt;copy&lt;/strong&gt; of the current version and mark them as snapshot which can be downloaded or promoted as the current version or deleted if not required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;generating-sas&quot;&gt;Generating SAS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/8ThrLEy.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shared Access Signature (SAS) is a &lt;strong&gt;string&lt;/strong&gt; appended at the &lt;strong&gt;end of the URL&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;accessing&lt;/strong&gt; a blob file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;actions-at-container-level-️️&quot;&gt;Actions at Container Level 🕵️‍♂️&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the container list you can select the action per container level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/4MHcSkh.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acquire lease&lt;/strong&gt; : No one can delete this container&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change access level&lt;/strong&gt; : You can change the public access level at container level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-blob-services&quot;&gt;Other Blob Services&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/Eah5XeO.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;containers&quot;&gt;Containers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create new container or see existing containers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;custom-domain&quot;&gt;Custom domain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/m3BsA4D.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
For the Azure storage account you can setup your own public domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;data-protection&quot;&gt;Data Protection&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/a61H9IX.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can update the recovery and tracking settings of your storage account. This settings also available when you are creating the azure storage account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;object-replication&quot;&gt;Object Replication&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/aysb3aT.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asynchronously copying your blob to another storage account. Example you can copy blobs from standard account to premium or vice-versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;azure-cdn&quot;&gt;Azure CDN&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/BX02dgg.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
Cache your content on the CDN and delivery to your user faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;azure-search&quot;&gt;Azure Search&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/gDLSxSa.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;static-website&quot;&gt;Static Website&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Website don’t require server side processing JAM stack sites can be hosted here. A special blob container will be created where you can host your website on your own domain.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Azure architects must aware of fundamentals of routing and peering. In this article we will see fundamentals as well as we will see some examples of routing and peering of networks in Azure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well before directly jumping in peering you must have your routing components fundamental cleared. Lets talk the very basic thing first Subnet then we will tackle routing and peering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-subnet-in-azure&quot;&gt;What is Subnet in Azure?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know VNet gives isolation or a private network boundary in Azure for the resources within your VNet. Similarly within the VNet if you want further boundary among resources then you can create subnets and put required resources within subnets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9eTyLgw.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A subnet is &lt;strong&gt;a range of IP addresses in the VNet.&lt;/strong&gt; You can divide a VNet into multiple subnets for organization and security. You can create subnets to create a logical boundary within VNet. You can think of creating subnets for Web Tier, Business Tier, Data Tier services and VMs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default resources among subnets can communicate without any extra configuration for a given VNet. If you want to restrict some traffic to a specific subnet within VNet then you can add NSG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--success&quot;&gt;🏆 &lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Since subnet size can’t be changed after assignment, use a subnet that’s large enough to accommodate whatever scale your app might reach. To avoid any issues with subnet capacity, you should use a /26 with 64 addresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-vms-in-subnet-communicate-with-other-subnet-vms&quot;&gt;How VMs in subnet communicate with other Subnet VMs?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each NIC in a VM is connected to one subnet in one VNet. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NICs&lt;/code&gt; connected to subnets (same or different) within a VNet can communicate with each other without any extra configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;system-routes-in-subnet&quot;&gt;System Routes in Subnet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;System routes are created by Azure when you create subnet. You can not create, modify or delete system routes. You can only overwrite them by creating &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview#custom-routes&quot;&gt;custom routes&lt;/a&gt; (BGP policy routes or User defined routes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every subnet has a route table that contains the following minimum routes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Route&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;LocalVNet&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Route for local addresses (no next-hop value)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;On-Premises&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Route for defined on-premises address space (VNet gateway is next hop address)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Internet&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Route for all traffic destined to the Internet (Internet Gateway is the next-hop address)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Z9At7eO.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;localvnet&quot;&gt;LocalVNet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If address is within the VNet address prefix – route to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;localVNet&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/X6i92nm.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;on-premises&quot;&gt;On-Premises&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the address is within the on-premises address prefixes or BGP published routes (BGP or Local Site Network (LSN) for S2S) – route to gateway&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If destination is an Azure datacenter address and ER (ExpressRoute) public peering is enabled – it is routed to the gateway.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jkHzFHW.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;internet&quot;&gt;Internet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the address is not part of the VNet or the BGP or LSN (Local Site Network) routes – route to internet via NAT
If the destination is an Azure datacenter with S2S or an ER without public peering enabled, it is routed to the Host NAT for internet path, but it never leaves the datacenter.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AKIZDSc.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;user-defined-route--udr-&quot;&gt;User Defined Route ( UDR )&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can create custom, or user-defined(static), routes in Azure to override Azure’s default system routes, or to add additional routes to a subnet’s route table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each route contains an address prefix and next hop type. When traffic leaving a subnet is sent to an IP address within the address prefix of a route, the route that contains the prefix is the route Azure uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/r0SvwBG.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever a virtual network is created, Azure automatically creates the following default system routes for each subnet within the virtual network:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Source&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Address prefixes&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Next hop type&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Default&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Unique to the virtual network&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Virtual network&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Default&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;0.0.0.0/0&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Internet&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Default&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;10.0.0.0/8&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;None&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Default&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;192.168.0.0/16&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;None&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Default&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;100.64.0.0/10&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;None&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possible Next hop from subnets are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Virtual Network&lt;/strong&gt;: routes traffic between address ranges within the address space of a virtual network. Azure does not create default routes for subnet address ranges. You don’t need to define gateways for Azure to route traffic between subnets. Azure automatically routes traffic between subnets using the routes created for each address range.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internet&lt;/strong&gt;: Routes traffic specified by the address prefix to the Internet. The system default route specifies the 0.0.0.0/0 address prefix.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;None&lt;/strong&gt; : Traffic routed to the None next hop type is dropped, rather than routed outside the subnet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;vnet-peering&quot;&gt;VNet Peering&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtual network peering enables you to seamlessly connect two or more Virtual Networks in Azure.
Azure supports the following types of peering:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Virtual network peering&lt;/strong&gt;: Connect virtual networks within the same Azure region.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global virtual network peering&lt;/strong&gt;: Connecting virtual networks across Azure regions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gateways-and-on-premises-connectivity&quot;&gt;Gateways and on-premises connectivity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peer Virtual Network can communicate to on-premise either by using its own gateway or it can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/hub-spoke?tabs=cli&quot;&gt;hub and spoke network topology&lt;/a&gt; where one VNet called &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Hub&lt;/code&gt; will have VPN Gateway that will be connected to on-premise. Rest of the VNet will use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Allow Gateway Transit&lt;/code&gt; and that way they will use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Hub&lt;/code&gt; VNet gateway. This kind of peer VNet is called as Spoke they use remote gateway to talk to on-premise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Aru17rt.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can create peering between VNets from same/different subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;httpss://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-network-interface&quot;&gt;Network Interface (NIC)&lt;/a&gt; enables an Azure Virtual Machine to communicate with internet, Azure, and on-premises resources. When creating a virtual machine using the Azure portal, the portal creates one network interface with default settings for you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Azure Storage account&lt;/strong&gt; is a &lt;strong&gt;resource&lt;/strong&gt; in Azure. Storage Account will give your group of services like &lt;strong&gt;Blob&lt;/strong&gt; Service, &lt;strong&gt;File&lt;/strong&gt; Service, &lt;strong&gt;Table&lt;/strong&gt; Service, &lt;strong&gt;Queue&lt;/strong&gt; Service. In this article I will walk you through the steps of creating your first Azure storage account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/0UoZ9OD.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/dMLZ7o2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Azure Storage Account provides a &lt;strong&gt;unique namespace&lt;/strong&gt; through which the contained storage objects are accessed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is located in a &lt;strong&gt;specific region&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have a certain &lt;a href=&quot;https://rupeshtiwari.com/azure-storage-replications-basics/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;replication&lt;/strong&gt; types&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Different account types and performance tiers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-azure-storage-account-basics-&quot;&gt;Creating Azure Storage Account Basics 🧮&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Login to https://portal.azure.com/ and create resource and search for &lt;strong&gt;Storage Account&lt;/strong&gt; and then create new storage account for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/jTJmWoP.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Name of the storage account should be &lt;strong&gt;unique&lt;/strong&gt; in Azure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For each of the services will be like below.
Pattern: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;YourName&amp;gt;&amp;lt;Service&amp;gt;.core.windows.net&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
Examples:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;https://rupesh.blob.core.windows.net&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;https://rupesh.file.core.windows.net&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;location&quot;&gt;Location&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location&lt;/strong&gt; of the data center is important like USA data centers may have large numbers of &lt;strong&gt;replication&lt;/strong&gt; data centers. However, Brazil datacenter location will have 2-3 &lt;strong&gt;replication&lt;/strong&gt; datacenter locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;performance&quot;&gt;Performance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/pL5m18r.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Performance tiers are of &lt;strong&gt;Standard&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Premium&lt;/strong&gt; type.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With premium only &lt;strong&gt;locally-redundant storage&lt;/strong&gt; is supported.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Files or Blobs or any resource &lt;strong&gt;can not automatically move&lt;/strong&gt; between &lt;strong&gt;Standard and Premium&lt;/strong&gt; Accounts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must do file copy in order to move them between &lt;strong&gt;Standard and Premium&lt;/strong&gt; Accounts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This setting &lt;strong&gt;can’t be changed after the storage account is created&lt;/strong&gt;. It is just like a type of account. Either you create standard or premium performance account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;account-kinds&quot;&gt;Account Kinds&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally you should select the &lt;strong&gt;general-purpose v2 (GPv2)&lt;/strong&gt; storage kind. Because this is the recommended type from Microsoft which has both blob storage and other features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;in-standard-performance-account&quot;&gt;In Standard Performance Account&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have &lt;strong&gt;3 options&lt;/strong&gt; to choose your account kinds:
&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/LArPndF.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;general-purpose v2&lt;/strong&gt; (StorageV2)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;general-purpose v1&lt;/strong&gt; (Storage)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BlobStorage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;general-purpose v2 (GPv2)&lt;/strong&gt; (👈 recommended) has all latest features is the default.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;general-purpose v2 (GPv2)&lt;/strong&gt; storage account provides access to all of the Azure Storage services: &lt;strong&gt;blobs, files, queues, tables, and disks&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPV1&lt;/strong&gt; v1 is when u want to integrate with &lt;strong&gt;VMs&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;older network&lt;/strong&gt; using classic Azure Model&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blob Storage&lt;/strong&gt;: only has the &lt;strong&gt;blob services&lt;/strong&gt; this is the &lt;strong&gt;legacy account&lt;/strong&gt; type.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;in-premium-performance-account&quot;&gt;In Premium Performance Account&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/nIK1GQL.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
You have &lt;strong&gt;4 options&lt;/strong&gt; to choose your account kinds:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;general-purpose v2&lt;/strong&gt; (StorageV2)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;general-purpose v2&lt;/strong&gt; (Storage)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BlockBlobStorage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FileStorage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;general-purpose v2&lt;/strong&gt; : stored in SSD drive&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;general-purpose v2&lt;/strong&gt;: stored in SSD drive&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Block Blob Storage&lt;/strong&gt;: has &lt;strong&gt;lower latency and high transaction&lt;/strong&gt; rates. It can only store blob and has &lt;strong&gt;no hot cold tiers&lt;/strong&gt; so no support for blob access tiers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;File Storage&lt;/strong&gt;: only for files + SSD and additional performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;replication&quot;&gt;Replication&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replication will make sure the data redundancy is happening. The default one is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replication options depends on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;location&lt;/strong&gt; of the storage account&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;performance type&lt;/strong&gt; of the storage account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;: If you select &lt;strong&gt;(Asia Pacific) Korea South&lt;/strong&gt; location &amp;amp; Standard performance account then you will only get &lt;strong&gt;LRS, GRS and RA-GRS&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/vy02TLS.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;in-standard-performance-account-1&quot;&gt;In Standard Performance Account&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/ma70t5Z.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
In standard performance account, If you select the location which has all replication options available then generally you will see &lt;strong&gt;6 replications&lt;/strong&gt; strategy options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example: for &lt;strong&gt;(Canada) Canada Central&lt;/strong&gt; you get all 6 replication strategies: &lt;strong&gt;LRS, ZRS, GRS, RA-GRS, GZRS,RA-GZRS&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;in-premium-performance-account-1&quot;&gt;In Premium Performance Account&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/CPaWzRY.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
In &lt;strong&gt;Premium performance&lt;/strong&gt; account, regardless of location you select. At this time &lt;strong&gt;only LRS&lt;/strong&gt; replication strategy is supported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;networking-&quot;&gt;Networking 🥅&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;connectivity-method&quot;&gt;Connectivity method&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/fTD49eo.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;public-endpoint&quot;&gt;Public endpoint&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your endpoint will be visible over the internet. So you can publicly access your account. You can enforce security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;selected-network-public-endpoint&quot;&gt;Selected Network Public endpoint&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restrict access to only selected network. Like only &lt;strong&gt;Certain vNet&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Subnets&lt;/strong&gt; can only access like &lt;strong&gt;VMs&lt;/strong&gt;. It will not allow over the internet access. You can also &lt;strong&gt;white list certain IP addresses&lt;/strong&gt; that allows them to connect to the storage account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;private-endpoint&quot;&gt;Private endpoint&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This creates the &lt;strong&gt;private IP address&lt;/strong&gt; for the &lt;strong&gt;storage account&lt;/strong&gt; on your own &lt;strong&gt;Azure vNet&lt;/strong&gt; which &lt;strong&gt;blocks&lt;/strong&gt; all connection to the &lt;strong&gt;public internet&lt;/strong&gt;. Only allows &lt;strong&gt;accessing storage account from On-Premises&lt;/strong&gt; if you connected your on-premise network to Azure using &lt;strong&gt;VPN&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;ExpressRoute&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;network-routing&quot;&gt;Network Routing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/8OqH0Vr.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--info&quot;&gt;You can decide how &lt;strong&gt;traffic&lt;/strong&gt; will be &lt;strong&gt;routed to the azure endpoint&lt;/strong&gt; by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;microsoft-network-routing-default-recommended&quot;&gt;Microsoft network routing (default 👍recommended)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Client should enter the &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Network&lt;/strong&gt; at the point &lt;strong&gt;closest&lt;/strong&gt; to the &lt;strong&gt;user location&lt;/strong&gt; called &lt;strong&gt;point of present&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;internet-routing&quot;&gt;Internet Routing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Client should enter the &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Network&lt;/strong&gt; at the point &lt;strong&gt;closest&lt;/strong&gt; to the &lt;strong&gt;storage account&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-protection-&quot;&gt;Data Protection 👮&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recovery&quot;&gt;Recovery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;turn-on-point-in-time-restore-for-containers&quot;&gt;Turn on point-in-time restore for containers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s you to restore the blob container into previous state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--warning&quot;&gt;⚠️When point-in-time restore is enabled, &lt;strong&gt;versioning&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;blob change feed&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;blob soft delete&lt;/strong&gt; are also enabled. The retention periods for each of these features must be greater than that of point-in-time restore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;turn-on-soft-delete-for-blobs&quot;&gt;Turn on soft delete for blobs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It creates a sort of &lt;strong&gt;recycle bin&lt;/strong&gt; ♻️ for your &lt;strong&gt;blobs&lt;/strong&gt;. In case if you deleted some blob you can restore them within the time limit that you set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;turn-on-soft-delete-for-containers&quot;&gt;Turn on soft delete for containers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It creates a sort of &lt;strong&gt;recycle bin&lt;/strong&gt; ♻️ for your storage &lt;strong&gt;container&lt;/strong&gt;. In case if you deleted container you can restore them within the time limit that you set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--warning&quot;&gt;⚠️Sign up is required on a per-subscription basis to use container soft delete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;turn-on-soft-delete-for-file-shares&quot;&gt;Turn on soft delete for File Shares&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It creates a sort of &lt;strong&gt;recycle bin&lt;/strong&gt; ♻️ for your &lt;strong&gt;file&lt;/strong&gt; shares. In case if you deleted some files you can restore them within the time limit that you set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Auto &lt;strong&gt;maintain previous versions&lt;/strong&gt; when they &lt;strong&gt;modified&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;deleted&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;turn-on-blob-change-feed&quot;&gt;Turn on blob change feed&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It stores all the &lt;strong&gt;transactional logs&lt;/strong&gt; for all of the changes happened to the &lt;strong&gt;blob&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;in&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;strong&gt;storage account&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;secure-transfer-required&quot;&gt;Secure transfer required&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enabled: Accessing endpoint over &lt;strong&gt;https&lt;/strong&gt; 👍 recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;allow-shared-key-access&quot;&gt;Allow shared key access&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;strong&gt;disabled&lt;/strong&gt; then client can only use &lt;strong&gt;roles in Azure AD&lt;/strong&gt; to authenticate in to the &lt;strong&gt;storage account&lt;/strong&gt;. And any request with shared key access will be denied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;minimal-tls-version&quot;&gt;Minimal TLS version&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set the TLS for all the apps under this storage account&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;infrastructure-encryption&quot;&gt;Infrastructure encryption&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default at rest all data is encrypted in azure storage account. However, you can add one more layer of encryption. ⚠️Signup is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;blob-storage&quot;&gt;Blob storage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;allow-blob-public-access&quot;&gt;Allow Blob public access&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if you &lt;strong&gt;disabled&lt;/strong&gt; public access at the storage account level you can still &lt;strong&gt;allow at container&lt;/strong&gt; level. If you &lt;strong&gt;enabled&lt;/strong&gt; at storage account level then still you can &lt;strong&gt;restrict public access&lt;/strong&gt; at the container level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;blob-access-tier&quot;&gt;Blob access tier&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Archive&lt;/strong&gt; tier is not available for Blob storage. Only hot and cold is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nfs-v3&quot;&gt;NFS v3&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Network File System(NFS) enables &lt;strong&gt;Windows or Linux clients&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;mount a container&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;Blob Storage&lt;/strong&gt; from a &lt;strong&gt;Azure Virtual Machine&lt;/strong&gt;(VM) . This is in preview and only available for few region as of now. ⚠️Signup is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;data-lake-storage-gen2&quot;&gt;Data Lake Storage Gen2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hierarchical-namespace&quot;&gt;Hierarchical namespace&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;strong&gt;disabled&lt;/strong&gt; then Blob storage uses &lt;strong&gt;virtual file system&lt;/strong&gt; by default that creates URL for a blob with no real folder structures. Each blob can be located by this URL format:
https://rupesh.blob.core.windows.net/&lt;strong&gt;container2&lt;/strong&gt;/&lt;strong&gt;myimages&lt;/strong&gt;/&lt;strong&gt;image.png&lt;/strong&gt;
That contains container name and sub folders name and file name. However they &lt;strong&gt;are not&lt;/strong&gt; really &lt;strong&gt;folders&lt;/strong&gt; they are just **part of the URL**.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;strong&gt;enabled&lt;/strong&gt; then below benefits will happen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blob storage will use &lt;strong&gt;actual file systems&lt;/strong&gt;. So you get actual folder structures and that helps to setup &lt;strong&gt;security&lt;/strong&gt; and other &lt;strong&gt;atomic operations&lt;/strong&gt; at folder level.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Lake Storage Gen2&lt;/strong&gt; is built on top of the Blob Storage Service. So it can be used by other Azure services like Azure HDInsight, Azure DataBricks and Azure Synapse Analytics&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;azure-files&quot;&gt;Azure Files&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;large-file-shares&quot;&gt;Large file shares&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is for Azure Files Services so that you can allow file share upto &lt;strong&gt;100TB of size&lt;/strong&gt;. Only &lt;strong&gt;Local&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Zone&lt;/strong&gt; redundant storage and it can &lt;strong&gt;not be turned off&lt;/strong&gt; when enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tables-and-queues&quot;&gt;Tables and Queues&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can add your own encryption keys for Tables and Queues and it can &lt;strong&gt;not be turned off&lt;/strong&gt; when enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tags-️&quot;&gt;Tags 🏳️&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is common feature for all Azure resources where you can create tags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;demo&quot;&gt;Demo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally you can review your account and create them. Enjoy your Azure Storage Account 😄&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Azure VNet is the fundamental unit of networking in Azure Cloud. You must know the basics of VNet. In this article we will explore Azure VNet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7x21cMd.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-azure-virtual-network&quot;&gt;What is Azure Virtual Network&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview&quot;&gt;Azure Virtual Network (VNet)&lt;/a&gt; is the fundamental building block for your private network in Azure. VNet enables many types of Azure resources, such as Azure Virtual Machines (VM), to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks. VNet is similar to a traditional network that you’d operate in your own data center, but brings with it additional benefits of Azure’s infrastructure such as scale, availability, and isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;core-vnet-capabilities&quot;&gt;Core VNet Capabilities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Isolation: VNet provides isolation in the Azure Cloud.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Internet Access: By default all resources under VNet has internet access.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Azure Resources: VMs or any cloud services can go under VNet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;VNet connectivity: VNet resources can connect to another VNet or On-Premise network or some other network like Google Cloud or Amazon cloud by using Azure Arc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Traffic Filtering: VNet provides isolation for traffic filtering. You can deploy dedicated subnet to do traffic filtering.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Routing: You can route traffic to various VNet and also within VNet all subnets can communicate to each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9eTyLgw.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;vnet-key-points&quot;&gt;VNet key points&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Primary building block of networking.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is a private network in Azure based on an address prefixes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can create many subnets within VNet using subnet prefixes (IP address ranges).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While creating VNet you must provide at-least one subnet regardless you use them or not.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can bring your own DNS or use Azure-Provided DNS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Choose to connect the network to on-premise or the internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;vnet-internet-access&quot;&gt;VNet Internet Access&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All resources in a VNet can communicate to the internet by default&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Private IP is &lt;a href=&quot;#snat&quot;&gt;SNAT&lt;/a&gt; to a public IP selected by Azure&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Outbound connectivity can be restricted via routes or traffic filtering&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inbound connectivity without SNAT requires public IP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--success&quot;&gt;🏆 &lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Name resolution between role instances or virtual machines in the same VNet you should use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Azure-Provided&lt;/code&gt; Server. However, if you want to resolve Azure hostnames from on-premises computers. You have to use Customer-managed DNS Servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;configuring-virtual-network-dns&quot;&gt;Configuring Virtual Network DNS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SelectVirtual Network in Azure&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select DNS Servers from the Settings section&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Choose Default (AzureProvided) to stick with Azure DNS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Choose Custom to input your own DNS Servers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add DNS Servers (preferably more than 1)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Save&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OonzPUH.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--warning&quot;&gt;⚠️ Note: VMs will require restart to utilize new or updated DNS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;virtual-machine-must-have-vnet&quot;&gt;Virtual Machine must have VNet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you create VM then You have to create (Virtual Network ) VNet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each VM need one private IP address so it can communicate to other VMs or devices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each VNet must contain 1 or more subnets and VM should be part of subnet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;VNet is assigned an IP Address Space it is a range of IP Addresses.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Subnet will have address space which is subset of VNet Address Space.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In Subnet VM will be assigned to a private IP within the assigned Address Space.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In VNet VMs from subnets can communicate each other without extra configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jbxFehc.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;snat&quot;&gt;SNAT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) allows traffic from a private network to go out to the internet. Virtual machines launched on a private network can get to the internet by going through a gateway capable of performing SNAT. The device performing NAT changes the private IP address of the source host to public IP address.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What is NAT, SNAT, DNAT etc. Why do we need them? What is the role of firewall in a Network and how firewall works with NAT, DNAT? Are you also seeking answers for these type of questions like I did? Read the article to get your answers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While learning Azure the main hurdle is the terms that are used in Azure Concepts. Even though you have given the Azure Fundamental Exam you will find many terms that you are not aware of. And that is the big hurdle in learning Azure Cloud Concepts. Therefore, I would advise you must first concrete all these terms before or while you learn Azure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are software developer and want to become cloud architect. Then you must aware of networking terminologies. I am not expert on networking as well. However, I am trying to explain whatever I understood about these concepts. Feel free to correct me and write your comments in the comment box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;local-network-devices-communication&quot;&gt;Local Network Devices Communication&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to connect to some device over the internet then you need a unique IP address assigned to your device as well as the device that you want to connect. In this world there are so many devices that it is almost impossible to put all devices on the internet with their unique IP addresses. It could be rupeshtiwari.com. You will use DNS to resolve the IP Address for your domain name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in your company or your home when you take internet connection mostly you will be given one IP address (200.0.0.1) that is internet facing. However, you may have 10 laptops, 10 mobiles, and 5 desktops and they can have have unique internal IP addresses which are unique within your local network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So then question arrises how can a person having mobile phone with local unique IP Address (192.168.0.1) can browse google.com? Also how google will respond to your local IP Address? Since your local IP Address is not internet facing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RVr1NVk.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to solve this problem you need a device that will translate the IP address of the mobile device (192.168.0.1) to the internet facing IP address (200.0.0.1) while you browse Google.com. Similarly when google will respond back then you again need to translate the IP address of the respond data to the local IP Address of your mobile phone (192.168.0.1). This is the solution. This way the devices within local network can easily communicate to the outer world. This is exactly &lt;strong&gt;NAT&lt;/strong&gt; does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;basics-of-nat&quot;&gt;Basics of NAT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NAT stands for Network Address Translation. In networking world there is NAT Device which is responsible for changing the IP address. It can either change destination or source address depending on how data has to flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sRmvRJ0.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In above example, we are using NAT to convert all traffic going towards internet or coming from internet. In above example NAT Device is changing change IP address to 200.0.0.1 for the data coming from local network. Similallary, NAT is used to convert all inbound traffic ( from internet to your local network ) to convert destination address to your local network’s common IP address which is 192.168.0.1 in above example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-role-of-firewall&quot;&gt;What is the role of Firewall&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When your device within your local network (company) wants to open a site that could be malicious for your company. How can you control that? Similarly from the outside world (internet) someone wants to connect to your company device and steal data or important private information. How would you control them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/pl8yP8t.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can create a whitelist where you allow a few IP addresses to communicate with your local network. Similarly for outbound traffic you can create black list of websites that you are not allowed to visit. All of this work is done by FIREWALL. In your network you can install a single firewall that can guard all devices, subnets within your network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think firewall as a security checkup for all traffic going out and into your local network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nat-and-firewall&quot;&gt;NAT and Firewall&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of now you understand that NAT has a separate role and Firewall has separate. They can not substitute each other. However, you need both of them if you want to communicate between 2 networks or the internet from a local network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xSAkv7j.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in the diagram below I drew Firewall and NAT together to give you a hint that at the door of your network you must put firewall and NAT together to manage outbound and inbound traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;snat&quot;&gt;SNAT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yUcQaSv.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) allows traffic from a private network to go out to the internet. Virtual machines launched on a private network can get to the internet by going through a gateway capable of performing SNAT. The device performing NAT changes the private IP address of the source host to public IP address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/DHXK4EI.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An employee sitting inside your company LAN and behind the firewall wants to browse google.com that time first routing decision will trigger once it is allowed to route to the internet then SNAT process will kick off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4KHKRui.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During &lt;strong&gt;SNAT&lt;/strong&gt; process only source address of the data packet is changed while passing through the &lt;strong&gt;NAT Device&lt;/strong&gt;. SNAT can be done for the traffic going outside from your local network. SNAT is possible from many hosts within your local network to many hosts outside network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dnat&quot;&gt;DNAT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Destination Network Address Translation (DNAT) changes the destination address in the IP header of a packet coming towards your local network from the internet. DNAT is used when we need to redirect incoming packets with a destination of a public address/port to a private IP address/port inside your network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ONg85Fu.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your company’s website is hosted inside your local Data Center or in the Azure cloud behind the Firewall and needs to be accessible to users over the Internet. In this citation you will use &lt;strong&gt;DNAT&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DNAT changes the &lt;em&gt;destination&lt;/em&gt; address of packets passing through the Router. Therefore, before routing, the off destination address of data is changed to the local network IP Device Address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YcAOpQ6.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DNAT can be done for the traffic coming from outside your local network. DNAT is possible from many hosts from outside network to only host within your local network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dns&quot;&gt;DNS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device. DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as 192.168.1.1 (in IPv4), or more complex newer alphanumeric IP addresses such as 2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2 (in IPv6).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A virtual private network (VPN) is a type of private interconnected network. VPNs use an encrypted tunnel within another network. I will explain what is VPN Gateway and how to deploy in Azure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;azure-vpn-gateways&quot;&gt;Azure VPN gateways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtual Network Gateway is of 2 types:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;VPN Gateway&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ExpressRoute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LXoNdle.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ExpressRoute&lt;/code&gt; is another gateway type which is most efficient and costly.If your organization uses Office 365. It wants to reduce traffic over the internet and send this traffic over a dedicated connection to Azure. Then ExpressRoute is the best choice. It’s a service that provides a direct connection from your on-premises datacenter to the Microsoft cloud. One disadvantage is it has no encrypted network communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/17uFd0u.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will focus VPN gateway only in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to setup below connections then you need VPN Gateway:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect on-premises data centers to Azure virtual networks through a &lt;em&gt;site-to-site&lt;/em&gt; connection.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect individual devices to Azure virtual networks through a &lt;em&gt;point-to-site&lt;/em&gt; connection.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect Azure virtual networks to other Azure virtual networks through a &lt;em&gt;network-to-network&lt;/em&gt; connection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5ChrRwG.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--success&quot;&gt;🏆 &lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can deploy only one VPN gateway in each virtual network, but you can use one gateway to connect to multiple locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;vpn-types&quot;&gt;VPN Types&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main difference of these two types of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;VPNs&lt;/code&gt; is how traffic to be encrypted is specified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9gsqcHn.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;policy-based&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;route-based&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;policy-based-vpns&quot;&gt;Policy-based &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;VPNs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policy-based VPN gateways specify statically the IP address of packets that should be encrypted through each tunnel.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/veC2bks.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Support for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IKEv1&lt;/code&gt; only.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Used for compatibility with legacy on-premises VPN devices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The source and destination of the tunneled networks are declared in the policy and don’t need to be declared in routing tables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rout-based-vpn&quot;&gt;Rout Based VPN&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With route-based gateways, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IPSec&lt;/code&gt; tunnels are modeled as a network interface or VTI (virtual tunnel interface). IP routing (static routes or dynamic routing protocols) decide across which one of these tunnel interfaces to send each packet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both types of VPN gateways (route-based and policy-based) in Azure use pre-shared key as the only method of authentication. Both types also rely on Internet Key Exchange (IKE) in either version 1 or version 2 and Internet Protocol Security (&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IPSec&lt;/code&gt;). IKE is used to set up a security association (an agreement of the encryption) between two endpoints. This association is then passed to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IPSec&lt;/code&gt; suite, which encrypts and decrypts data packets encapsulated in the VPN tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;components-of-vpn-gateway-in-azure&quot;&gt;Components of VPN Gateway in Azure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need below 6 resources to be created and configured in order to setup site-to-site connection with VPN Gateway:
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/40PIjPB.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VNet&lt;/strong&gt;: Only one VPN Gateway can be deployed in a Single VNet. While creating VNet give enough address space to accommodate future subnets.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GatewaySubnet&lt;/strong&gt;: You need a dedicated subnet for VPN Gateway. You have to call this as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GatewaySubnet&lt;/code&gt;. You can not use this subnet for other service. Make sure you give &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/27&lt;/code&gt; address mask to make sure you have enough IP addresses for future growth. Also remember sometime you want to put 2 VPN Gateways in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Active/Standby&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Active/Active&lt;/code&gt; mode within this subnet in order for redundancy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Virtual Network Gateway&lt;/strong&gt;: Create Virtual Network Gateway of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;VPN&lt;/code&gt; type. This will route the traffic from on-premise to Azure VNet and vice-versa.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public IP address&lt;/strong&gt;: Create &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Dynamic Public IP Address&lt;/code&gt; resource. This address will only change if you delete and recreate the VPN. This IP will be internet facing and your on-premise VPN Device can point to this IP Address.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local Network Gateway&lt;/strong&gt;: This is created to represent on-premise network’s configurations. This configuration includes the on-premises VPN device’s public &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IPv4&lt;/code&gt; address and the on-premises routable networks. This information is used by the VPN gateway to route packets that are destined for on-premises networks through the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IPSec&lt;/code&gt; tunnel.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6oqv3B7.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connection&lt;/strong&gt;: Create a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;connection&lt;/code&gt; resource. Connect VPN Gateway with on-premise VPN Device IPv4 address. Connect VPN Gateway with it’s Public IP Address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mV537mU.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;on-premise-resources&quot;&gt;On-Premise resources&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need Physical VPN Device and a Public-Facing IPv4 address in your data center to connect to Azure resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;high-availability&quot;&gt;High Availability&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since all traffic has to go from VPN Gateway. You must think of what will happen in case of any issues. We have to work on fault tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use 2 VPN Gateways one in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Active/Standby&lt;/code&gt; and other is in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Active/Active&lt;/code&gt; mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;active--standby&quot;&gt;Active / Standby&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On any planned maintenance or un-planned interruption affects active instance then within &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;90&lt;/code&gt; seconds the standby gateway will become active &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;automatically&lt;/code&gt; without any human involvement. This is excellent feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fYtUs8W.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;active-active&quot;&gt;Active/ Active&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this mode you have to deploy &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;2 VPN gateways&lt;/code&gt; with 2 &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;distinct IP Addresses&lt;/code&gt;. Then on-premise will have &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;2 VPN devices&lt;/code&gt; to connect with them. With this you see how much traffic can be distributed among these 2 gateways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Uc42Bje.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;site-to-site-vpn-gateway-deployment&quot;&gt;Site to Site VPN Gateway Deployment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to create these 2 sites and connect them using vpn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ygx7RHO.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-first-step-is-to-create-both-sites-in-azure&quot;&gt;The first step is to create both sites in Azure.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s create HQ-Network and Azure-VNet1 sites in Azure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;create-azure-vnet&quot;&gt;Create Azure VNet&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While create &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;VNet&lt;/code&gt;, we also create a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;services&lt;/code&gt; subnet. You need &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Address-Prefixes&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Subnet-Prefixes&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-powershell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;az&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;network&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;vnet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--resource-group&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;learn-a6e8a4cb-44d7-4c35-b40c-9a61faff22e0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Azure-VNet-1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--address-prefixes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;10.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;/16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--subnet-name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--subnet-prefixes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;10.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;/24&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4umnnbA.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;create-gatewaysubnet&quot;&gt;Create GatewaySubnet&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need Gateway subnet to be created and for that we need &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;address-prefixes&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GatewaySubnet&lt;/code&gt; will remain under &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Azure-VNet1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-powershell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;az&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;network&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;vnet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;subnet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--resource-group&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;learn-a6e8a4cb-44d7-4c35-b40c-9a61faff22e0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--vnet-name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Azure-VNet-1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--address-prefixes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;10.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;/27&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;GatewaySubnet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MeuR0jg.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;local-network-gateway-representing-head-quarter-vnet&quot;&gt;Local Network Gateway representing Head Quarter VNet&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Local Network Gateway(LNG) is a specific object that represents your on-premises location (the site) for routing purposes. You give the site a name by which Azure can refer to it, then specify the IP address of the on-premises VPN device to which you will create a connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local Network Gateway will point to gateway ip address which is the Public IP(PIP) Address of the Head Quarter Network. I will assign this ip address later once I create PIP of HQ-Network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-powershell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;az&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;network&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;local-gateway&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--resource-group&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;learn-a6e8a4cb-44d7-4c35-b40c-9a61faff22e0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--gateway-ip-address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;94.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;252&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;160&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;LNG-HQ-Network&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--local-address-prefixes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;172.16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;/16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YDeLkLE.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, you go ahead and create Site for Head Quarter Network also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;verify-network-topology&quot;&gt;Verify Network Topology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/huDWqOx.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2nd-step-create-a-site-to-site-vpn-gateway-by-using-azure-cli-commands&quot;&gt;2nd Step Create a site-to-site VPN gateway by using Azure CLI commands&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will create:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;VNet for gateway&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;VPN gateways&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Public IP Address&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create connection&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Azure Storage has no upfront cost, no termination fees and pay only for what you use. In this article you will learn about Azure storage access tiers and their pricing. It will help you to decide which file type to put in which access tier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;access-tiers&quot;&gt;Access Tiers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For &lt;strong&gt;block blobs&lt;/strong&gt; in Blob and &lt;strong&gt;General Purpose V2&lt;/strong&gt; storage accounts &lt;strong&gt;tiers can be used&lt;/strong&gt; for block blobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/lc46XGO.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access tiers of &lt;strong&gt;Hot or Cool&lt;/strong&gt; can be set at the &lt;strong&gt;storage account level&lt;/strong&gt; as the default for blobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/wvxHWSN.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you upload a blob without selecting tier it will by default infer to the account level access tier configuration value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/HXSSXBc.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a &lt;strong&gt;per-blob basis&lt;/strong&gt; any of the tiers can be configured for &lt;strong&gt;block blobs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;strong&gt;premium tier&lt;/strong&gt;, but this is set for the &lt;strong&gt;storage account type&lt;/strong&gt; and can’t be changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total amount of storage is at the storage account level and not at the tier level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/ZqMH62d.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
For File Sharing we do not have &lt;strong&gt;archive&lt;/strong&gt; tier only Premium, Transaction optimized, Hot and Cool is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;block-blob-storage-access-tier-types&quot;&gt;Block Blob Storage Access Tier Types&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Premium&lt;/strong&gt; - Low latency, highly performant (separate account type)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hot&lt;/strong&gt; - Data that is actively used&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cool&lt;/strong&gt; - Data that is less frequently used but needs to be immediately available.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Archive&lt;/strong&gt; - Data that must be kept for extended duration and can tolerate multiple hours to access the data.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As move from &lt;strong&gt;hot -&amp;gt; cool -&amp;gt; archive&lt;/strong&gt; the cost of storage goes down but the cost of transactions increases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/fpNa8in.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Archived&lt;/strong&gt; data can not be downloaded it is not available live. Archive data must be first bring to either cool or hot then only you can download them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;blob-access-tier&quot;&gt;Blob Access Tier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 2 types of storage accounts &lt;strong&gt;Premium storage account type&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Standard GPv2 storage account type&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only below type of services can have these 2 types of storage accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managed Disks&lt;/strong&gt; (Most expensive)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Files&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Block Blobs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Azure Data Lake Storage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gpv2-storage-account&quot;&gt;GPv2 Storage Account&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPv2 Storage account&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Blob Storage Account&lt;/strong&gt; type has 3 access tiers (hot,cool and archive). These account types are also called as &lt;strong&gt;Standard Performance Tiers&lt;/strong&gt;. You can move data in between Hot, cold and archive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hot-access-tier&quot;&gt;Hot access tier&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;storage&lt;/strong&gt; cost&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lowest&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;data access&lt;/strong&gt; cost&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;: application that actively read or write files or staging data that gets uploaded and needs to be processed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cool-access-tier&quot;&gt;Cool access tier&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;data access&lt;/strong&gt; cost&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lowest&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;storage&lt;/strong&gt; cost&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cost is in between Hot and Archive.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;: You don’t plan to access as often but you can still get them quickly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;archive-access-tier&quot;&gt;Archive access tier&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;data access&lt;/strong&gt; cost&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lowest&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;storage&lt;/strong&gt; cost&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Takes upto &lt;strong&gt;15 hours&lt;/strong&gt; to fetch data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data is &lt;strong&gt;offline&lt;/strong&gt; most of the time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can request to fetch early in case of &lt;strong&gt;emergency&lt;/strong&gt; and get within &lt;strong&gt;1 hour&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supports LRS,GRS,RA-GRS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;: you want to keep for longer time backup, raw data, like uncut media files or source data gone through ETL process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;premium&quot;&gt;Premium&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Premium&lt;/strong&gt; has one tier only no hot ,cool or archive here. Uses &lt;strong&gt;SSD&lt;/strong&gt; to store your data so &lt;strong&gt;performance&lt;/strong&gt; is high and price is also high. It is also called as &lt;strong&gt;Block Blob Storage Account&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantage&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Not support page blob&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Not available everywhere&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;LRS and ZRS only supported&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;azure-service-pricing&quot;&gt;Azure Service Pricing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/q1d8jqJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
Below are Azure storage solutions and there prices are different and they support Access Tier pricing plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Managed Disks (Most expensive)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Files&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Block Blobs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Azure Data Lake Storage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;strong&gt;Tables storage, Queues and Page Blobs&lt;/strong&gt; they do not support access tier pricing plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;factors-impacting-azure-blob-storage-price&quot;&gt;Factors impacting Azure Blob storage price&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pricing &lt;strong&gt;depends&lt;/strong&gt; on below &lt;strong&gt;factors&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Redundancy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;LRS (locally redundant storage)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;ZRS (zone redundant storage)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;GRS (geographically redundant storage)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;RA GRS (read-access geographically redundant storage)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;GZRS (geographically zone redundant storage)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;RA GZRS (read-access geographically zone redundant storage)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Region&lt;/strong&gt; where data will be stored&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;United States&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;India etc.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cool-and-archive-early-deletion-charges&quot;&gt;Cool and Archive early deletion charges.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Archive deletion charges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minimum 180 days you must keep your file in archive tier. If you delete or move archive file earlier than &lt;strong&gt;180 days&lt;/strong&gt; then pro-rated charges will be deducted. For example, if a blob is moved to archive and then deleted or moved to the hot tier after 45 days, you’ll be charged an early deletion fee equivalent to 135 (180 minus 45) days of storing that blob in archive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cool file deletion charges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If a blob is inferred as cool based on the storage account’s default access tier and the blob is moved to archive, there is no early deletion charge.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If a blob is explicitly moved to the cool tier and then moved to archive, the early deletion charge applies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;data-storage-pricing&quot;&gt;Data storage pricing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/rFFDCSg.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pay more to store it and less to interact for higher tier. &lt;strong&gt;Premium&lt;/strong&gt; is most &lt;strong&gt;expensive&lt;/strong&gt;. Hot is expensive than cool and archive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/lsTiuH6.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reading-data-pricing&quot;&gt;Reading data pricing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hot is cheaper and Cool is medium and Archive is more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lifecycle-management&quot;&gt;Lifecycle Management&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/Eh8UwYh.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can modify the access tier of any data manually at anytime but this is very time consuming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/wqip57j.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I would advise you to modify the access tier of any data automatically based on the certain static and dynamic rules. It can apply to all blobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can define rules to delete files or change access tier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/PxLGpWn.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the path or indexed tags you can filter. Based on the certain dates also you can filter and define action to change tier or delete files.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Are you wondering how can you separately track the billing of your resources allocated in same subscription? Did you think you could save money by turning off your DEV Virtual Machines over weekends, holidays or everyday evening? In this article I will discuss with you how can you achieve all of these by using Azure tags effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;azure-tags&quot;&gt;Azure Tags&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure has tags that can be applied to some resource. Tag has key and value. Key can is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;case-insensitive&lt;/code&gt; however, the value of the tag is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;case-sensitive&lt;/code&gt;. You can use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/code&gt; object to store as the value of the tag as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example of tag is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProductOwner&lt;/code&gt; is the tag and it’s value could be &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Arun&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Yogesh&lt;/code&gt; depending on the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;question-arises-why-do-i-create-tag-and-how-tags-are-helpful&quot;&gt;Question arises why do I create tag and how Tags are helpful?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well you can use tags in below scenarios to improve your cloud experiences:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use an &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Environment&lt;/code&gt; Tag to rack deployment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use Environment tag in Automation Runbooks`&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CostCenter&lt;/code&gt; tag to track osts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Azure Policy&lt;/code&gt; to enforce ag usage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t clobber your tags in the zure CLI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-environment-tag-to-track-deployment&quot;&gt;Create &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Environment&lt;/code&gt; tag to Track Deployment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Key&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Value&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environment&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DEV , QA , UAT, PRO etc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose, now if you want to share DEV, QA, UAT environments in the same subscriptions then you can quickly identify resources per environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rzRYlVB.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-tags-in-automation-runbooks&quot;&gt;Use Tags in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Automation Runbooks&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use environment tag to set up Runbook to automatically shut off all DEV Virtual Machines in the weekend and the evenings. That will reduce the monthly bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-costcenter-tag-to-track-cost&quot;&gt;Use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CostCenter&lt;/code&gt; Tag to track Cost&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apply &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CostCenter&lt;/code&gt; tag to the allocated resources to the team or department that are responsible for the cost of those resources. Then you can go to Azure Cost Management search cost for the tags by &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CostCenter&lt;/code&gt; tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Key&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Value&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CostCenter&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Finance or IT or Sales&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1MDqvzm.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-azure-policies-to-enforce-tag-usages&quot;&gt;Use Azure Policies to enforce tag Usages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure policy can be applied from management group. MS has built-in policy to enforce tag on resource. Once you apply the policy then after 24 hours you will go to the compliance report and notice how many resources are not applied tags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-clobber-your-tags-in-the-azure-cli&quot;&gt;Don’t Clobber your tags in the Azure CLI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before add/delete/update a tag on the resource using Azure CLI. Pull all the tags in the resource and then perform the action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;Reference&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/0uXKnai.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blobs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Files&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Queues&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tables&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Disks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;azure-blobs-storage&quot;&gt;Azure Blobs Storage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/OmyjBKy.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is an &lt;strong&gt;object storage&lt;/strong&gt; solution&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unstructured data&lt;/strong&gt; can be stored&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 types of blobs: block,append and page&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;files, documents, binary data like image, video, audio files, databases and disks can be stored in blob storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;azure-files&quot;&gt;Azure Files&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Similar to Azure Blob it can store &lt;strong&gt;unstructured data&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any type&lt;/strong&gt; of file&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Support &lt;strong&gt;SMB protocol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attach&lt;/strong&gt; file share &lt;strong&gt;to VM&lt;/strong&gt; just like network share&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Application which can not talk to blob api and need Network file share then you can use Azure files to access files on network.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;File share can be connect to on-premise computer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;azure-tables&quot;&gt;Azure Tables&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structured&lt;/strong&gt; data only&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data broke down into Fields&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;NoSQL database for fast read and write&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You could use SQL database also&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cosmos-db&quot;&gt;Cosmos DB&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cosmos DB&lt;/strong&gt; is another &lt;strong&gt;service&lt;/strong&gt; for Azure Table. - NoSQL database - built-in feature to distributing your app globally. - However, storage account specific to region and region pair. So cosmos DB is more reliable. - built-in strategy to migrate Azure Table to cosmos db.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;azure-queues&quot;&gt;Azure Queues&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Store &amp;amp; retrieve &lt;strong&gt;messages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Asynchronous reliable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;good for &lt;strong&gt;microservices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;azure-service-bus&quot;&gt;Azure Service Bus&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is another &lt;strong&gt;service&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;Azure Queues&lt;/strong&gt; called &lt;strong&gt;Azure Service Bus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;azure-disks&quot;&gt;Azure Disks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is used by VMs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They are stored as type of Page Blob&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can upload your own VMs disk using PowerShell or Portal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;accessible&quot;&gt;Accessible&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure CLI, Azure storage Explorer, Azure portal, AZ copy, Powershell and program everyone can use &lt;strong&gt;REST API&lt;/strong&gt; to access all data. All of the data are exposed to REST endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;security&quot;&gt;Security&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can limit who can access your data. You can encrypt by your own encryption keys for &lt;strong&gt;blobs and files&lt;/strong&gt; services by uploading on Azure Key Vault. By default Microsoft put all data encrypted at rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;durable-and-highly-available&quot;&gt;Durable and highly available&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure stores 3 copies of data in the data-center that you will choose. You can failover to other redundant data storage at anytime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;storage-capacity&quot;&gt;Storage Capacity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Per Azure Storage Account you can store 5 PiB of data including blob, files, queues, disk, tables etc. You can create multiple accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pricing&quot;&gt;Pricing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/le3lzyz.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Block Blobs are cheaper than Files. Blob storage is cheaper than File storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scalable&quot;&gt;Scalable&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure storage is highly scalable.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;How to manage DEV, QA and PROD environments in Azure Cloud? You end-up creating many resources and now how would you organize them for QA, DEV, UAT environments? Let’s talk about the same in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Azure we create resource like web app, azure functions. Then we group them in resource groups. In order to manage pricing and bill we create azure subscriptions. We put Azure resource groups under subscription. So before I keep on going let me explain few concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-azure-resource&quot;&gt;What is Azure Resource?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Azure Service instance is called a resource. If you create a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;VNet&lt;/code&gt; then it is called a resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-azure-resource-group&quot;&gt;What is Azure Resource Group?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose you want to create a Web App, Cosmos DB, Azure Function and a Queue in Azure Storage that will serve one website that you have made for your company. You should create a resource group that is a logical container for all of the resources that I listed above. You can give the name as RG-DEV. So you may create DEV, QA, UAT, PROD resource groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;azure-subscription&quot;&gt;Azure Subscription&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subscription in Azure is for billing purposes. Per subscription you will have one Billing Administrator who is responsible for paying monthly bills of Azure resource usages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under subscription you can create Resource Groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-you-want-to-manage-subscriptions&quot;&gt;Why do you want to manage subscriptions?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are working in a large company then you will have lots of resources then in a single tenant. Then you can use resource groups to organize your resources. Similarly you will create many subscriptions to control billing or resources. Like you may create DEV, QA, UAT and PROD subscriptions. However, how would you apply governance and compliances to these subscriptions? Azure Management Group helps us to improve governance and compliance for organizations with many subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;management-groups&quot;&gt;Management Groups&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has announced the general availability of Azure management groups in 2021, which provide the ability to organize and apply governance to all subscriptions in a management group. You can use Policies, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;RBAC&lt;/code&gt; are the tools that you will use when you create Management Groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon has &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/02/aws-organizations-now-generally-available/&quot;&gt;AWS Organizations&lt;/a&gt; , Google has the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-platform-resource-hierarchy&quot;&gt;Resource Manager hierarchy&lt;/a&gt; which is the same as Azure Management Groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizations can now apply governance and compliance rules at all levels within the management group, which consequently get inherited by all subscriptions in the hierarchy under the specific group. One of these is setting &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-policy/azure-policy-introduction&quot;&gt;Azure policies&lt;/a&gt;, which enforce &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-policy/json-samples&quot;&gt;rules and effects&lt;/a&gt; on Azure resources, like permitting only a subset of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SKUs&lt;/code&gt; for virtual machines or conforming to a naming standard. Another option of Azure management groups is implementing access management over multiple subscriptions using &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview&quot;&gt;role-based access control (RBAC)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policies and rules defined in a management group cannot be overridden at a lower level in the hierarchy, therefore giving strict guidance over the subscriptions. Some essential restrictions should be adhered to when working with Azure management groups:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A single directory supports a maximum of 10000 management groups.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The management group tree can support up to eight levels of depth, which includes the root level and subscriptions level.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A management group can have multiple children; however, subscriptions and management groups can only have a single parent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The subscriptions and management groups are all part of a single hierarchy in each directory.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Custom RBAC roles are &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedback.azure.com/forums/911473-azure-management-groups&quot;&gt;currently&lt;/a&gt; not supported by management groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6Nlr47u.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementation of Azure management groups starts with &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management-groups-create&quot;&gt;creating a management group&lt;/a&gt;, for which Benoit Hamet created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.hametbenoit.info/2018/08/01/azure-azure-management-groups-is-now-available/&quot;&gt;step-by-step overview&lt;/a&gt;. The implementation process will construct the root management group and then move all existing subscriptions here. After creation of a management group, the directory administrator must &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/elevate-access-global-admin&quot;&gt;elevate&lt;/a&gt; themselves as the owner of the group. Subsequently, additional management groups can be added to build up the complete hierarchy tree. To place a group on &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management-groups-manage#move-management-groups-in-the-hierarchy&quot;&gt;another level in the hierarchy&lt;/a&gt; it needs to be made a child of another management group. The same goes for &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management-groups-manage#move-subscriptions-in-the-hierarchy&quot;&gt;subscriptions&lt;/a&gt;, by moving these between the groups. Accordingly, repositioning subscriptions or management groups within the hierarchy allows the re-use of governance controls, as these will then inherit rules and policies of the parent management group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Management groups helps us to improve:
Access control among various subscriptions
Improve security
Implement governance
Improve compliance by applying company department wise policies
Better visibility and maintainability of cloud consumptions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enterprise-hierarchy-examples-creating-dev-qa-and-prod-in-azure-cloud&quot;&gt;Enterprise Hierarchy Examples: Creating DEV QA and PROD in Azure Cloud&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose you have a company where you develop websites and LOB applications for your finance service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will create 2 Management groups: one for Finance and another for the IT department. I would call them as departments. I will then create some high level policies at this level which will be inherited by all subscriptions and resources under them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next for the finance department I will create 1 Account owner and administrator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/L4iDMBR.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I will create 2 Subscriptions one for DEV and other for TEST. All the resources that we will deploy for development I would put them in DEV subscription. Next all the resources that QA will test I will put them under TEST subscription.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For production, I will create a separate department called IT department to put in some extra governance and compliances. Create a new subscription for PROD resources. Then I will create a PROD subscription to manage its billing separately. Finally, I will create a resource group for PROD and put resources under them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Next I am going to use &lt;strong&gt;Azure Container Registry Service&lt;/strong&gt; to create new container registry.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Under &lt;strong&gt;repository&lt;/strong&gt; of my container registry My MVC application docker image will appear.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visual Studio will package my app into a &lt;strong&gt;docker image&lt;/strong&gt; and deploy to my &lt;strong&gt;azure docker container registry&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once my docker image any docker host like &lt;strong&gt;Azure Container Instances&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Azure Kubernetes Service&lt;/strong&gt; (AKS).&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Right click application and publish&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select Docker Container Registry&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Next select azure container registry&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select your resource group and azure container registry to publish then select publish. It will take some time to publish your image to Azure Container Registry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-the-meaning-of-word-kubernetes&quot;&gt;What is the meaning of word Kubernetes?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The name &lt;strong&gt;“Kubernetes”&lt;/strong&gt; stems from an ancient Greek word for “helmsman,” (someone who steers a ship, like a container ship) which explains the ship wheel logo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Kubernetes Cluster concepts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Azure Container Registry&lt;/strong&gt; has Docker Image and in order to connect to your own docker container image you will get &lt;strong&gt;container name&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;registry name&lt;/strong&gt; that will help you to host your docker image to any Azure container hosting services.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Azure Kubernetes Cluster&lt;/strong&gt; host the docker container and exposes the container into public &lt;strong&gt;8080&lt;/strong&gt; port using in-built high performance &lt;strong&gt;load balancer&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;You need &lt;strong&gt;pod&lt;/strong&gt; workflow from Kubernetes Cluster which will connect to the container registry using container name and registry name and create internal 80 port for your app.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Next you need &lt;strong&gt;service&lt;/strong&gt; to expose internal port 80 to public 8080 over load balancer.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While creating Kubernetes Cluster remember 3 things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authentication method&lt;/strong&gt;: required to connect Azure Container Registry to get the docker image.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integration&lt;/strong&gt;: Which Container Registry to select your own Container Registry that is we created where we have our docker image.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can check the &lt;strong&gt;performance&lt;/strong&gt; of your container by going to the Monitor Insights. Once our container will be deployed to the Kubernetes then we can observe performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the YML for creating POD in k8 cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TCP:&lt;/strong&gt; is a transport-layer protocol, and HTTP is an application-layer protocol that runs over TCP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand the difference between TCP and HTTP you need to understand the idea of a layered networking model. Essentially, there are different protocols that let a computer talk at different distances and different layers of abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQFidHOoxBXcxQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1629980753836?e=1635379200&amp;amp;v=beta&amp;amp;t=ejscPivqV22eHtkynxLjj1NrEolsm3GA0HjLji4ZjNw&quot; alt=&quot;No alt text provided for this image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;networking-system-layers--tcp-udp-fundamentals&quot;&gt;Networking system layers &amp;amp; TCP UDP Fundamentals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the very bottom of the network stack is the &lt;strong&gt;physical layer&lt;/strong&gt;. This is where electrical signals or light pulses or radio waves actually transmit information from place to place. The physical layer doesn’t really have protocols, but instead has standards for voltages, frequencies, and other physical properties. You can transmit information directly this way, but you need a lot of power or a dedicated line, and without higher layers you won’t be able to share bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next layer up is the &lt;strong&gt;link layer&lt;/strong&gt;. This layer covers communication with devices that share a physical communications medium. Here, protocols like Ethernet, 802.11a/b/g/n, and Token Ring specify how to handle multiple concurrent accesses to the physical medium and how to direct traffic to one device instead of another. In a typical home network, this is how your computer talks to your home “router.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third layer is the &lt;strong&gt;network layer&lt;/strong&gt;. In the majority of cases, this is dominated by Internet Protocol (IP). This is where the magic of the Internet happens, and you get to talk to a computer halfway around the world, without needing to know where it is. Routers handle directing your traffic from your local network to the network where the other computer lives, where its own link layer handles getting the packets to the right computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we are getting somewhere. We can talk to a computer somewhere around the world, but that computer is running lots of different programs. How should it know which one to deliver your message to? The transport layer takes care of this, usually with port numbers. The two most popular transport layer protocols are &lt;strong&gt;TCP and UDP.&lt;/strong&gt; TCP does a lot of interesting things to smooth over the rough spots of network-layer packet-switched communication like reordering packets, retransmitting lost packets, etc._ UDP is more unreliable, but has less overhead._&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’ve connected your browser to the web server software on the other end, but how does the server know what page you want? How can you post a question or an answer? These are things that application-layer protocols handle. For web traffic, this is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). There are thousands of application-layer protocols: SMTP, IMAP, and POP3 for email; XMPP, IRC, ICQ for chat; Telnet, SSH, RDP for remote administration; etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the five layers of the TCP/IP networking model, but they are really only conceptual. The OSI model has 7 layers. In reality, some protocols shim between various layers, or can work at multiple layers at once. **&lt;em&gt;TLS/SSL _**_for instance provides encryption and session information between the network and transport layers.&lt;/em&gt; Above the application layer, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) govern communication with web applications like Quora, Twitter, and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Azure portal is great while visualizing Azure log and metrics. You can see the pie chart, graph for resources like VMs etc. You can also create your custom multiple dashboard views with these visualizations. This article will help you to prepare for &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-303&quot;&gt;az-303: Microsoft Azure Architect Technologies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;visualize-azure-monitor-logs-and-metrics-&quot;&gt;Visualize Azure Monitor Logs and Metrics 📈&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use below services to visualize log data &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/visualizations&quot;&gt;Learn them in detail&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Workbooks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Power BI&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Azure Dashboards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Grafana&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Azure Monitor Views (deprecated)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Custom Applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;metrics&quot;&gt;Metrics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Specify the resource group and resource you want to see metrics for like VM or function app.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Choose which metrics you want to see like VM CPU utilization etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;workbooks&quot;&gt;Workbooks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workbooks&lt;/strong&gt; are interactive documents that provide deep insights into your data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can create empty or use template (like VM performance) to create your new workbook&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must need specify log analytics workspace to workbooks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Time Range last 4 hours data etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;azure-dashboards&quot;&gt;Azure Dashboards&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/E3nrxc5.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Azure Portal you can have multiple dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can create your own Dashboard for one VM resource and add below stuff like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;VMs performance Metrics&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clock&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Multiple chart and diagrams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In this article you will learn how you can upload a file to the server using node.js and HTML5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;client-side-file-upload&quot;&gt;Client side file upload&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the client side we need to use a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;file&lt;/code&gt; type &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; html element that can hold the file content from the client machine/device. Remember file type input element will parse the data and put it in the form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;file&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;filetoupload&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;br&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The input element with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;type=”file”&lt;/code&gt; allows us to choose one or more files from your device (mobile or machine). That chosen file can be uploaded to the server using form submission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--success&quot;&gt;🏆 &lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Using the File API, which was added to the DOM in HTML5, it’s now possible for web content to ask the user to select local files and then read the contents of those files. This selection can be done by either using an HTML &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input type=&quot;file&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element or by drag and drop. The File API makes it possible to access a FileList containing File objects representing the files selected by the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-multipartform-data&quot;&gt;What is multipart/form data?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose you have large or small unstructured data. Suppose you want to upload an image file or excel file. At that time you must consider uploading the file to the server as binary data. It’s just an array of integers with 0 and 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, you should instruct your html form to &lt;strong&gt;not encode&lt;/strong&gt; the form file input value and just send it to the server as raw binary data format. In order to achieve this you must set &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;enctype=&quot;multipart/form-data&quot;&lt;/code&gt; in your form tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;action=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;fileupload&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;method=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;post&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;enctype=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;multipart/form-data&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;file&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;filetoupload&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;br&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;submit&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, I want to send the data as binary array format to the server. And let the server do the parsing of the file and create or save a file in the server disk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So by this time we understood that from the client machine I can use the browser to read my file content and put it in the HTML form for further access. I will create a submit button to post the form with the content of the file uploaded by the client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-parse-files-on-the-server&quot;&gt;How to parse files on the server?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well you could do your own parsing, however I will choose &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/formidable&quot;&gt;formidable&lt;/a&gt; node package to do the parsing for me. This module is excellent and it can be used for video and image files as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the server file let’s create an upload method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ts highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;/fileupload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;form&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;formidable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;IncomingForm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fields&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;files&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;newpath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;C:/Users/Rupesh/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;files&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;filetoupload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;oldpath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;files&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;filetoupload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;rename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;oldpath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;newpath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;files&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;filetoupload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; File uploaded and moved!`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;testing-file-upload&quot;&gt;Testing file upload&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;run-the-server-npm-run-server&quot;&gt;Run the server &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm run server&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;inspecting-multipart-form-data&quot;&gt;Inspecting multipart form data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told you that client browser can submit the file content in binary data. If you want to visualize the form data. Then upload any file and use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.telerik.com/fiddler&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fiddler&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and check how content in binary data format looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I can see my file got saved in my desired disk.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Did you know you can enable web application tracing, performance check, request response time trace and exception tracing all free using Azure Application Insight. Learn how to implement and configure app insight in your .net application. This article will help you to prepare for &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-303&quot;&gt;az-303: Microsoft Azure Architect Technologies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;azure-monitor-insights&quot;&gt;Azure Monitor Insights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Azure Monitor Insights&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;group of services&lt;/strong&gt; for getting &lt;strong&gt;customized&lt;/strong&gt; monitoring reports for &lt;strong&gt;applications and services&lt;/strong&gt;. They collect and analyze both &lt;strong&gt;logs and metrics&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure Monitor Insights for below resources are available:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Application Insights: Help you monitor live &lt;strong&gt;web application&lt;/strong&gt; on any platform.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Containers: Helps you to monitor the &lt;strong&gt;performance&lt;/strong&gt; of container workloads.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Networks: Provides a comprehensive view of network &lt;strong&gt;health&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;metrics&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cosmos DB&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Resource Group&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Storage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;VMs&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Redis Cache&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;application-insights&quot;&gt;Application Insights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workspace-based Application insights (recommended) needs &lt;strong&gt;Log Analytics Workspace&lt;/strong&gt; so make sure you create that first and then App Insights can help on below things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tracing&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Host diagnostics from Azure or Docker&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Diagnostic trace logs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Custom events and metrics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use these data to visualize using:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Application Map&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Profiler&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Usage Analysis&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Diagnostic Search for instance data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visual Studio&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will create workspace-based App Insights so that logs can be sent to Azure Analytics Workspace further it can be used in Azure Sentinel. We will also use automatic approach to send telemetry data to the Azure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a web application .net framework&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install the Application Insights Telemetry on this project&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create Log Analytics Workspace on Azure portal&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create Application Insights on Azure portal&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get the instrumentation key from the overview of the App Insights.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Update the MVC project web.config with the Key so that your app will send&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rupeshtiwari/app-insight-demo-mvc-net&quot;&gt;source code for implementing Azure App Insights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Are you wondering how to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng-show&lt;/code&gt; in Angular 11? There is a way to achieve it by using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[hidden]= “false”&lt;/code&gt;. However, if you are migrating large &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;angularjs&lt;/code&gt; projects into &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;angular 11&lt;/code&gt; then it is really tedious and error prone work to convert them into &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[hidden]=&quot;&quot;&lt;/code&gt; expression format. Also you have to negate all existing logic to show the element while using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;hidden&lt;/code&gt;. In this article I will explain how you can create your own &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ngShow&lt;/code&gt; directive in Angular 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically we are saying we want to replace below angular js code&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-show=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;”vm.canShow()”&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Angular 11 style code like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;[ngShow]=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;”canShow()”&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HsAXJsD.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng-show&lt;/code&gt; directive is going to be used in various modules in your project. Therefore, I have decided to put this directive in a shared module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s create one shared module in angular and create a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng-show.directive.ts&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WMXyUFT.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-ngshow-directive-in-angular-11&quot;&gt;Creating ngShow directive in Angular 11&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add below code in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng-show.directive.ts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ts highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Directive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ElementRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;@angular/core&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/**
 * ## Example
 * ```html
 * &amp;lt;button [ngShow]=&quot;show&quot;&amp;gt;Create&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
 * ```
 * ```ts
 * get show() {
 *   return false; // it will hide button. If you pass `true` it will show button.
 * }
 * ```
 */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;Directive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;[ngShow]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NgShowDirective&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ngEl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ElementRef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;Input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ngShow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;condition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;show&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;condition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;show&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ngEl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nativeElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it. Next let me show how this can be used in App Module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-use-ngshow-in-angular-11&quot;&gt;How to use NgShow in Angular 11&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-1-import-the-shared-module-in-appmodule&quot;&gt;Step 1: Import the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;shared module&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AppModule&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ts highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;NgModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;declarations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;AppComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;imports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BrowserModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SharedModule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;providers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;bootstrap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;AppComponent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;AppModule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-2-use-the-ngshow-directive&quot;&gt;Step 2: Use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ngShow&lt;/code&gt; directive.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;[ngShow]=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;show&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;We have created custom `ngShow` directive to show hide this text.&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ts highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;@angular/core&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;app-root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;templateUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;./app.component.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;AppComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;show&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In this article I will explain how you can create your own ngShow directive in Angular 11.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/qxXxmBa.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/qxXxmBa.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Azure Cost Management &amp;amp; Billing Basics</title><link href="https://www.rupeshtiwari.com/azure-cost-management-and-billing-basics/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Azure Cost Management &amp;amp; Billing Basics" /><published>2021-08-28T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-08-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.rupeshtiwari.com/azure-cost-management-and-billing-basics</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.rupeshtiwari.com/azure-cost-management-and-billing-basics/">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For entire azure resources even across subscriptions if you want to know about your &lt;strong&gt;billing, invoice, budget, alerts, recommendations&lt;/strong&gt; then you must go to &lt;strong&gt;Azure Cost Management&lt;/strong&gt; and billing page in Azure portal. This article will help you to prepare for &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-303&quot;&gt;az-303: Microsoft Azure Architect Technologies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Azure Monitor&lt;/strong&gt; also helps us to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Monitor the resource cost&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get cost reports&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Setup budget and alert&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/vYFVU0q.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
Cost Management &amp;amp; Billing is service in Azure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In overview screen you will see:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History&lt;/strong&gt; of all the previous bills&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Which specific &lt;strong&gt;resource&lt;/strong&gt; cost you &lt;strong&gt;more price&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You want to connect your Azure resources from your on-premise office machine or home laptop right? So how would you do that? Read this article. In order to connect machine/servers residing over your on-premise office from home you need internet. You know anything over internet is not secure. So how would you secure your connection?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-can-i-connect-machine-or-server-residing-in-my-on-premise-office&quot;&gt;How can I connect machine or server residing in my on-premise office?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well you need internet and route your connection to you office machine. For that you have to expose your office server or machine IP addresses over internet so that you can connect them. However, this will put your official data at risk. Now anyone over internet can connect your machine and stole data. Or hacker can trap your communication over internet and hack your data or machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QS10v0g.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-would-i-secure-my-data-while-connecting-to-on-premise-office-servers&quot;&gt;How would I secure my data while connecting to on-premise Office servers?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VPN&lt;/strong&gt; is the secure way to connect to other machines over internet. If you want to connect machine which is in your office building from your home. You need internet and the data that you will transfer from your office to your home is exposed to internet. Any malicious user can access/read/manipulate that data. In order to secure your traffic data over internet. You must need &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;VPN&lt;/code&gt; connection. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;VPN&lt;/code&gt; creates a encrypted tunnel from your home laptop to the office machine. All data is isolated/encrypted using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;different IPSec tunnels&lt;/code&gt; created by VPN. Now your data over internet is secure in-transit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wf42pox.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-i-connect-azure-resources-from-my-home-pc-or-office-pc&quot;&gt;How do I connect Azure Resources from my Home PC or office PC?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have on-premise office or home laptop to connect Azure VNet. You need &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;VPN&lt;/code&gt; setup with physical device in on-premise location. And you need &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;VPN Gateway&lt;/code&gt; on Azure &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;VNet&lt;/code&gt;. A &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;VPN Gateway&lt;/code&gt; is used when creating a VPN connection from your on-premises network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NMq78SM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to put your azure resources in private network over cloud. You must create &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;VNet&lt;/code&gt; and assign all resource to that VNet in a same region. All resources within VNet must be in one region. So you must create VNet in Azure cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/media/design/point-to-site.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have your own on-premise office or home laptop to connect to your Azure resources. Which is in VNet you must use VPN technology to connect to your Azure resources inside VNet.
You could use other options like Express Route circuit which is costly and fast option. In this article I will discuss VPN option. VPN uses internet to flow your data. However Express Route uses dedicated connection that doesn’t uses internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-i-need-vnet-in-azure&quot;&gt;Why I need VNet in Azure?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;VNet&lt;/code&gt; is a private network in cloud. Just like on-premise we create network.
All resources inside Azure VNet can browse internet. (outbound is allowed by default)
&lt;strong&gt;However, from internet you can not connect to the VM or any resources present within a VNet by default inbound are restricted from any public IP&lt;/strong&gt;. In order to perform this activity you must deploy Azure Public IP resource in your VNet. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview#communicate-with-the-internet&quot;&gt;Read more here.&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, VNet provides isolation to your Azure resources over cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--success&quot;&gt;🏆 &lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was wondering &lt;strong&gt;Why we are able to communicate our web apps in Azure from internet?&lt;/strong&gt;
And I found this answer promising. &lt;strong&gt;By default, apps hosted in App Service are accessible directly through the internet.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/networking-features&quot;&gt;Read more here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-do-i-need-in-azure-cloud-to-allow-vpn-connection&quot;&gt;What do I need in Azure Cloud to allow VPN connection?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to configure and allow connection of on-premise VPN to VNet in Azure ( also called as site to site or point to site ). In Azure cloud you must create &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Virtual Network Gateway&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;VPN Gateway&lt;/code&gt;. This VPN Gateway allows VPN traffic to flow in your Azure VNet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to create Azure &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Virtual Network Gateway&lt;/code&gt;, you have to first create &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GatewaySubnet&lt;/code&gt;. Because VPN Gateway needs dedicated subnet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/SHuiEd0.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--success&quot;&gt;🏆 &lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Only one &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;VPN Gateway&lt;/code&gt; is allowed in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Azure Virtual Network (VNet)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-i-secure-my-azure-resources-within-vnet&quot;&gt;How do I secure my Azure resources within VNet?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now in order to restrict which traffic can flow to your Azure VNet resources. You must configure &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Azure Firewall&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Network Security Group&lt;/code&gt;. To restrict outside IP address traffic in VNet you must configure &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Azure Firewall&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to restrict traffic within VNet then you must configure &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Network Security Group&lt;/code&gt; in subnet. Suppose within your VNet you created 2 Subnet. One subnet called as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;subnet-web&lt;/code&gt; for Web Apps. Which are exposed to public IP address. So that people can access your app. Then in this subnet you need different rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hjLbP0i.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You created another &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;subnet-business&lt;/code&gt; where you deploy resources containing your business rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You created another &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;subnet-data&lt;/code&gt; where you deploy resources containing your databases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you want to restrict that any resources in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;subnet-web&lt;/code&gt; can not communicate directly to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;subnet-data&lt;/code&gt; resources. You need to create &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Network Security Group (NSG)&lt;/code&gt; in order to achieve this security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, you want to restrict both &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;subnet-data&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;subnet-business&lt;/code&gt; resources from outside world even from VPN clients. You have to setup &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Azure Firewall&lt;/code&gt; which works at VNet level. There you can create rule that outside traffic can not directly go to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;subnet-data&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;subnet-business&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-i-create-subnets-in-azure-how-it-help-securing-resources&quot;&gt;Why do I create Subnets in Azure, how it help securing resources?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I categorize Azure resources in 3 divisions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Public/Internet exposed resources&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Internal business resources&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Private resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to secure private resources over azure. We should restrict outside IP addresses to communicate our private Azure resources like Azure storage, DB, Key Vault etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To secure resources in Azure we can use below Azure services:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Azure Firewall&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Network Security Group&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Application Gateway. (2 and 3 are required when we have multiple subnets. Partitioning resources in various subnets are recommended also.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For robust security, we must deploy both Azure Firewall and Azure Network Security Group or Azure Application Gateway. I personally prefer &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Azure Firewall and Application Gateway&lt;/code&gt;. Because Application Gateway provides easy and friendly way to manage resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to separate resources in private and public access category and secure them accordingly we need to create Azure Subnet. We want strong security for our private resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can create 1 Subnet where we put resources which are open for public like public &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;web apps&lt;/code&gt;. Like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Sample Test Exams&lt;/code&gt; which is exposed to public over internet. We can call this subnet as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;subnet-public&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create another subnet where deploy resources which are only available to internal business users like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CORE CMS&lt;/code&gt;. We can call this subnet as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;subnet-internal&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create another subnet which should contain resources that we should keep private, secured from any users and restricted outside IP to access or connect. Those resources could be &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;azure storage, cosmos DB or other databases and azure key vaults etc.&lt;/code&gt;. Therefore, we can create another subnet call it &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;subnet-private&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, In order to secure &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;subnet-private&lt;/code&gt; such that outside IP can not connect, we must deploy &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NSG or application gateway&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;subnet-private&lt;/code&gt; and configure such that only our &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;subnet-public&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;subnet-internal&lt;/code&gt; resources can communicate to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;subnet-private&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;securing-azure-resources-using-3-tier-architecture&quot;&gt;Securing Azure resources using 3 Tier Architecture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also create classic 3-tier architecture in Azure where we create 3 subnets as listed below:
1- &lt;strong&gt;subnet-web&lt;/strong&gt; ( private exposed to some public IP or internet)
2- &lt;strong&gt;subnet-business&lt;/strong&gt; ( private )
3- &lt;strong&gt;subnet-data&lt;/strong&gt; ( private )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Subnet-Web&lt;/code&gt; can only communicate with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Subnet-Business&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Subnet-Business&lt;/code&gt; can only communicate with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Subnet-Data&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Subnet-Business&lt;/code&gt; and S&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ubnet-Data&lt;/code&gt; are &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; exposed to any &lt;em&gt;public access&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/DMpA0o3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;subnet-web&lt;/code&gt; we deploy resources that can be exposed to internet. Such as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;web apps&lt;/code&gt;.
In &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;subnet-business&lt;/code&gt;, we deploy resources where only &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;subnet-web&lt;/code&gt; can connect to. Example: Function apps, where we write business logic and handlers.
In &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;subnet-data&lt;/code&gt;, we deploy private resources such as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;azure storage, cosmos DB or other databases and azure key vaults etc.&lt;/code&gt; And only &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;subnet-business&lt;/code&gt; can connect to these resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way we can secure our private resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If in your Azure, your are putting all resources in single subnet or no subnet just VNet. And exposing to internet via filtering selected IP addresses. Still we are at risk since we exposed all resources over the internet via selected IP. You must think to protect Databases, Keyvaluts etc. and do not allow any public connection by any means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;securing-azure-resources-using-azure-firewall&quot;&gt;Securing Azure resources using Azure Firewall&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Azure Firewall&lt;/code&gt; can filter all perimeter network. You can also put filter such that all the traffic towards your VNet should go through Firewall. If you have hybrid connection then on-premise traffic can also be diverted to go through Azure Firewall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/pcZVspH.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your subnets within the Spoke VNet can be configured to use UDR (user defined routes). Where you can put the routing rules. Like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;subnet-web&lt;/code&gt; can not talk to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;subnet-data&lt;/code&gt; etc. Also we need to setup rules that traffic on subnets within spoke VNet should go out through &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Azure Firewall&lt;/code&gt; only.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Have you realized writing code that is not &lt;strong&gt;production ready&lt;/strong&gt; is not good practice? Have you seen code which violates the &lt;strong&gt;DRY&lt;/strong&gt; principle? Did you notice &lt;strong&gt;specs/unit-test&lt;/strong&gt; in your code base which is missing important specs and has tests for the things which are not important with respect to a given &lt;strong&gt;PBI&lt;/strong&gt; or task required ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, I will list out all the best practices that a developer should follow to become a responsible senior developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-do-i-mean-by-responsible-developer&quot;&gt;What do I mean by Responsible developer?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A responsible developer has following attributes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While working if you learned something, you document them and share with your collogues in code walk-through ceremony.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While you are working on project and you find some code refectory that you could do to improve code base quality. You will do that and inform your senior about that.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whenever, your senior explains you something important related to project or any best-practice. You should note that and next time when you participate in meeting make sure you recollect the previous learning and apply it in future discussions. Example: In your angular project, If you have been told that you should never mutate &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;model&lt;/code&gt; state in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;component&lt;/code&gt; class. You must ask question why? Next you should note this point and remember. Next time during modeling session, if someone propose solution where they are trying to mutate model in component you should bring this point and correct them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-modeling-session-for-developers&quot;&gt;What is a modeling session for developers?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After sprint grooming and planning is done. Developers collaborate together and discuss high level solution/approach to the given user story. This session is called &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;modeling session&lt;/code&gt;. In the modeling session developers discuss the given Business User Acceptance Requirements. They come up with an optimal approach to solve the problems by following the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;clean code principle&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;best practices&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;their industry practices and patterns&lt;/code&gt;, design philosophy like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DDD (Domain Driven Design), SOA (Service Oriented Architecture)&lt;/code&gt; etc. Next they divide the solutions into small tasks, distribute among them and go to their respective work stations and write the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;code&lt;/code&gt;, write the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;specs/unit-test&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;deploy&lt;/code&gt; to QA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-do-architects-expect-from-senior-developers&quot;&gt;What do Architects expect from Senior Developers?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you are given a bug you should be able to fix it &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;independently&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You should be able to model &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;independently&lt;/code&gt; and come up with an approach that meets all the requirements of the given task or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PBI&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you show your approach to the architect it should full-fill all the modeling check-list.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you are given a task you should be able to finish &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;independently&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You should discuss your approach with architects before you start writing code.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep showing your work frequently to get feedback and prepare to change your approach as you go. Make sure you develop with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;TDD&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the architect is not available or in meetings then keep posting your screenshots in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AOF&lt;/code&gt; group. Architects will review as they get time. You will not wait to get feedback and continue your work since you already discussed the approach. However, be prepared to change your approach or code as per the Architect Feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would recommend creating a chat group called Architecture Oversight Feedback group where developers post their source code pictures as they develop if architects are not available to check your source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-improve-on-modeling-and-solve-problems&quot;&gt;How to improve on modeling and solve problems?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing is You should learn fundamental building blocks of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;your project&lt;/code&gt; that you have been assigned. Then I will explain you what are the check-list you can follow while doing modeling. I will also show you my approach that I follow to solve problems to avoid architectural mistakes. Finally, you will learn in your project what are the files you should unit-test them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s understand our angular project architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;angular-project-architecture&quot;&gt;Angular Project Architecture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to me, In a typical angular project you will have the following things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model&lt;/strong&gt; is a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;data-structure&lt;/code&gt; that has public properties. Do not put any logic keep this as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;datastructure&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Store&lt;/strong&gt; is the home for the model and it has all the queries made on the model.&lt;br /&gt;
 Example: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ClassificationSetStore&lt;/code&gt; has a single item as the current classification set. If the classification set has levels which are required or is a query in the store,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Components&lt;/strong&gt; have 2 types: parent, child. All use cases are in the parent component. The rendering concerns are in the child component.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ApiService&lt;/strong&gt; should call an angular HTTP client. It should not do any logic.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service&lt;/strong&gt; has business logic, makes HTTP calls using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ApiService&lt;/code&gt; and updates the model if required. Example: use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apiService&lt;/code&gt; to post HTTP to create items. On success get the new id, version from the output and update the model with the new version or id. If you are following NgRX then your effect will make HTTP calls and reducer will update store on action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6i2SxSG.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--warning&quot;&gt;⚠️ Note: This project structure may differ as per your company’s project architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;while-modeling-what-guideline-i-should-follow&quot;&gt;While Modeling What guideline I should follow?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have been assigned a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PBI&lt;/code&gt; or task where you have to come up with a solution and also write production code. First step is to model your solution and find the approach. Discuss your approach with senior After that you can start coding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;overall-modeling-strategy&quot;&gt;Overall Modeling Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read below before you are solving any problem for a given task or story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Follow the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself&quot;&gt;DRY principle&lt;/a&gt;, check if you are duplicating any logic if yes then justify. Try to avoid it. If you can not justify and you have to put a duplicate then talk to the architect.
&lt;em&gt;Don’t avoid &lt;strong&gt;DRY&lt;/strong&gt; because it may cause many deep hidden design/technical issues.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns&quot;&gt;Separation of Concerns&lt;/a&gt;, check if the logic is spread across many places already or in your design then put them all in one place. And manage the related concerns in one place.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Following the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID&quot;&gt;SOLID principle&lt;/a&gt; strictly, this is mandatory.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be consistent, check existing design in your project most of the time you will be solving a problem which is already solved. Therefore, you should not waste time to re-invent the wheels. Just follow the same design and structure that you have in your project. It will save your and team time. This is most important principle to remember always be &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;consistent in your project&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, I will give you some examples about &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DRY&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Separation of Concerns&lt;/code&gt; principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-below-guidelines-while-designingsolving-angular-problems&quot;&gt;Use below guidelines while designing/solving Angular Problems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read below before you are going to decide your solution in Angular project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Models&lt;/strong&gt; can be directly updated from HTML since we are doing 2 way-data binding and template form. Model gets updated directly from HTML.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Models can’t be updated directly from component methods. You must send a message to update the model. Write a service to listen to messages and update models.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Queries&lt;/strong&gt; for models are in the store file. Components should not write it’s own logic to query the model for any property.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Component&lt;/strong&gt; HTML must be divided into &lt;strong&gt;parent and child&lt;/strong&gt;. Child will get input from the parent using the @Input property defined in the Child component. Parents will receive a notification when the child will emit using the @Output &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;EventEmitter&lt;/code&gt; property. Example: Classification Set has levels. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;LevelsComponent&lt;/code&gt; is a child component that gets the levels to display from the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ClassificationSetComponent&lt;/code&gt;. In order to delete a level, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;LevelsComponent&lt;/code&gt; will emit a delete with the level Id. Then &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ClassificationSetComponent&lt;/code&gt; will implement the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;deleteLevel&lt;/code&gt; method invoked on delete.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Child Component&lt;/strong&gt; should only get input and emit the output event. It should not have any logic to decide whether to show a button or not. This logic should be in parent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you have parent and child components, make sure all use-case implementations are in the &lt;strong&gt;Parent component&lt;/strong&gt; only. So in the previous example &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ClassificationSetComponent&lt;/code&gt; will have add level, delete level, create classification set etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-the-smart-component&quot;&gt;What is the Smart Component?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the Parent components are modeled as Smart components. Below are the characteristics of Smart Components:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It should have all &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CRUD&lt;/code&gt; use cases for that component.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can send command to update a model which service can listen and call api to update model.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can make a query to store and create data structures with the decision whether to show a delete button in the child component or not.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It can query stores to get models.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It should pass all the data required for its child component.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It should implement the @Output events coming from the child component.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-the-presentation-component&quot;&gt;What is the Presentation Component?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Child component which is only responsible to render data is called &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Presentation&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Dumb&lt;/code&gt; Component. Below are the characteristics of Smart Components:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It should take input data and emit events using angular @Output.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It decides how to render a component. Should I use a bootstrap table or angular material table or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jQuery&lt;/code&gt; table etc. What would be the color of the text etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It will emit the output anytime it has to change the model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once your design or modeling is done please read the checklist again and make sure your discovered approach is not violating any of these points. If you need help bring your architects in the room and ask questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;example-model-manage-employee-angular-components&quot;&gt;Example: Model Manage Employee Angular Components &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design Angular components. You should be able to add Employee, show the added employee in the table and delete employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solutions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;EmployeeList&lt;/code&gt; Component is Dumb it takes list of employees render in table. It emits a delete message when the user clicks on the delete button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ManageEmployee&lt;/code&gt; Component will read the employee list from store and it will implement delete use-case where it sends a message to delete employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With above knowledge you should be good to solve any angular problems. Now if you started writing code. You must start writing unit test first, then write corresponding production code. That is what we call Test Driven Development TDD. Lets understand what are the files you should test and what best practice you should follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;follow-tdd-test-driven-development-strictly&quot;&gt;Follow TDD (Test Driven Development) strictly&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write the test first before you write production code. That is called TDD ( Test Driven Development ). In code walkthrough ceremony, show you spec first before showing your code. If you write bad spec, it may cause build failure and slow down you and other people work as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;new Date()&lt;/code&gt; in your spec models. Rather use predictive time or create &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IProvideDate&lt;/code&gt; service and use it in your code base to provide datetime value. This way you can easily mock your date time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mock any side-effects that can happen in your spec. Below are some list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Date time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set Timeout&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Web API calls&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Alert or Confirm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;while-writing-specsunit-tests&quot;&gt;While Writing Specs/Unit-Tests&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to write specs for the following things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Component&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Api Service&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Store&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;testing-angular-service&quot;&gt;Testing Angular Service&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angular service is where I will write business logic and web api calls. So we must assert all the mutation done on model and any api call happened with correct payload and URL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must assert the following conditions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is calling &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apiService&lt;/code&gt; with the correct parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It updates the model correctly ( if &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apiService&lt;/code&gt; output is a new Id or version then check if the model is updated with the same.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;testing-angular-components&quot;&gt;Testing Angular Components&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must test your component when it is created without model data.  Another scenario with model data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;testing-smart-components&quot;&gt;Testing Smart Components&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With empty Model:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is sending the correct command with required data.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It should create correct data structure to pass child component&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With populated model retrieved from server test below:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It should send correct commands by checking data coming from the server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;testing-presentation-component&quot;&gt;Testing Presentation Component&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check correct outputs are emitted&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check rendered HTML ( use JEST snapshot feature ) Presentation component is responsible for rendering the exact same HTML every-time you give the same input data. So you should snap-shot the HTML rendered for a given input in your specs and always assert if that is not changed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;testing-store&quot;&gt;Testing Store&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Test any complex query if it has one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;testing-api-service&quot;&gt;Testing Api Service&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure you pass correct parameters to the angular &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;HttpClient&lt;/code&gt; service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;testing-models&quot;&gt;Testing Models&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly you will try to keep your models &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;anemic&lt;/code&gt; in client side. Rather write &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;service&lt;/code&gt; and put business logic over there. So I would advise not to write any specs on models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;testing-datetime&quot;&gt;Testing DateTime&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your model is use property with date time type. Then never-ever use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;new Date()&lt;/code&gt; to assign the value. Always create a dedicated service to provide you new Date. So that you can always mock that service while testing. You must make your date predictable every time so that It does not break in build machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SystemDateTimeProvider&lt;/code&gt; class and use this class in your service to create model with date time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ts highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Injectable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;@angular/core&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;abstract&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;DateTimeProvider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;abstract&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;abstract&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;Injectable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SystemDateTimeProvider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;DateTimeProvider&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your spec you can now easily mock the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;new()&lt;/code&gt; method and return some constant date that will always remain same and never break in build machine or some other person machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;modeling-examples&quot;&gt;Modeling Examples&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;practical-modeling-example-1&quot;&gt;Practical Modeling Example 1&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirement:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When approval is given, then hide the save button and make all widgets read only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution Team came up with was:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IT Ops had an Item Editor and we had a Save Widget button over there. We wanted to hide the button when&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approval is given. We added the logic to subscribe to the Approval Received event there to hide the button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Every widget we also added the same logic to subscribe to the Approval Received event and apply read-only lock to all them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check what violation we are doing in the above example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in the above example we are violating both the DRY and Separation of Concerns principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Subscribe Approval Received and lock widget logic is in each and every widget, which is a violation of the DRY principle. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;WidgetStack&lt;/code&gt; component can only subscribe to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ApprovalReceived&lt;/code&gt; event and pass an input value to all the widgets to lock them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We also violated separation of concern IT Ops is not supposed to listen to business events and change the button that belongs to widget service. Better solution is to move the button inside the widget stack and let the widget stack hide and show the button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;practical-modeling-example-2&quot;&gt;Practical Modeling Example 2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirement:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a Classification Set which will have definitions and levels. Users can create classification sets, add level, delete level, and the delete button should be shown to the user defined levels only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution Team came up with was:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Created one component which does&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Render the definition&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implement create definition&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Updating the model in component for every time different type is selected, sections have to change&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Render all system defined levels&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implement delete levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check what violation we are doing in the above example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One component is doing both rendering and implementing logic to update the model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a Classification Set as a smart component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implement create definition ( and send message to create so not modify model here)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implement delete level ( and send message to delete level so not modify model here)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a data structure with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt; value to know which level can be deleted based on the type of the level. ( user defined level can only be deleted )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create Classification Levels as a presentation component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get the list of levels to display with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt; to show the delete button or not.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Render the list in angular material&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On click of delete output the delete with the level index or level Id.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create Classification Definition as a presentation component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get the data to display&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add template form in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; with validations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Output create when the user wants to create a new definition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know if you think any further improvement we can do to make yourself a better responsible senior developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Azure Monitoring&lt;/strong&gt; is a product that helps you to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deliver &lt;strong&gt;predictable performance and availability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identify &lt;strong&gt;performance bottlenecks&lt;/strong&gt; and existing &lt;strong&gt;network issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identify other dependencies issues and external storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Azure &lt;strong&gt;VMs scale sets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hybrid VMs&lt;/strong&gt; connected with &lt;strong&gt;Azure Arc&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On-premises&lt;/strong&gt; virtual machines&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Virtual machines hosted in &lt;strong&gt;another cloud&lt;/strong&gt; environment like AWS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#creating-log-analytics-workspace&quot;&gt;Create a Log Analytics Workspace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add &lt;strong&gt;VMInsights solutions&lt;/strong&gt; to the Workspace.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Install&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;agents&lt;/strong&gt; on virtual machine and virtual machine scale sets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;limitations-on-linux-vms&quot;&gt;Limitations on Linux VMs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;VMs &lt;strong&gt;Red Hat Linux (RHEL)6&lt;/strong&gt; does not support “&lt;strong&gt;Available Memory&lt;/strong&gt;” feature from Azure Monitoring.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metrics&lt;/strong&gt; are only available for data disks on Linux VMs using &lt;strong&gt;XFS filesystems or EXT filesystem&lt;/strong&gt; family (EXT2,EXT3,EXT4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;monitoring&quot;&gt;Monitoring&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/W5ZpfLv.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have created VM in azure then you can see &lt;strong&gt;insights&lt;/strong&gt; under Monitoring group of VMs. You can &lt;strong&gt;enable&lt;/strong&gt; monitoring for the virtual machine which will &lt;strong&gt;install&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;strong&gt;agent&lt;/strong&gt; on VM to work with Azure Monitor.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/14Xqb1v.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
You must connect to Log Analytics Workspace also. Then after 5-10 mins VM will start sending data to the Azure Monitoring. All the data goes to Azure Analytics Workspace.
You see 3 kinds of data in Azure monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;map&quot;&gt;Map&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/pRUjhup.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Log Analytics workspace helps us to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creates alerts when CPU goes high etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Kusto Queries(KQ)&lt;/code&gt; Language to search and analyze logs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect with other Azure services like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Azure Sentinel&lt;/code&gt; for security analytics for entire enterprise.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Do you have node.js project that has specs and you want to make sure these specs run when you push your code to GitHub repo? Well you must setup CI in your project to avoid failing specs to be pushed to remote origin. Read this article to learn how can you setup CI for node.js project using GitHub Actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nodejs-template-to-run-specs&quot;&gt;Node.js Template to run specs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitHub provides Node.js workflow template to run your specs and install dependencies whenever you push to your main or master branch. Learn more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/building-and-testing-nodejs&quot;&gt;the node.js GitHub template here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-nodejs-workflow-template-file-steps&quot;&gt;My Node.js Workflow template file steps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I want to run my specs only in one node.js version &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;12.x&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I created a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;main.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.github/workflows&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the workflow that I created for my node.js project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mainyaml-complete-nodejs-template-for-github&quot;&gt;Main.yaml complete node.js template for GitHub&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Node.js CI&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;branches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;pull_request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;branches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;jobs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;runs-on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;ubuntu-latest&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;actions/checkout@v2&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Use Node.js&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;actions/setup-node@v2&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;node-version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;12.x&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;registry-url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;https://registry.npmjs.org&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;@octocat&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;npm ci&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;npm run build --if-present&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;npm run test:once&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;running-github-workflow-to-test-nodejs-specs&quot;&gt;Running GitHub workflow to test node.js specs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I push my code in GitHub actions I see my CI build is passing. I am happy now 😄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EqzRNv2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;running-github-workflow-for-failing-tests&quot;&gt;Running GitHub workflow for failing tests&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets fail specs and push our code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/62uxSSG.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets go over GitHub actions and check if our build is passing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vkhha97.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, In my repo I see failing symbol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me check actions there I see my build failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LenaHeo.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the detailed error&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/uPZ1UDw.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you feel, did you setup differently let me know what improvement I can do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-can-i-reject-push-from-repository-members-using-github-actions&quot;&gt;How can I reject push from repository members using GitHub Actions?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t use GitHub Actions to prevent a push; you would need a pre-receive hook to do that. GitHub’s cloud version doesn’t currently support that, although GitHub Enterprise Server (the on-premises version) does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57741805/how-can-i-reject-push-from-repository-members-using-github-actions&quot;&gt;stack-overflow answer here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-i-did-to-reject-push-if-build-failed-in-github-actions&quot;&gt;What I did to reject push if build failed in GitHub actions?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically the rules that I follow in my project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;for each work always create Feature branch.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you feature branch build is passing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then only merge your code to main/master branch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can always setup branch policy that no one directly push to your main/master branch. Everyone has to create pull request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That way you can secure your code base in master/main branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this is helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-skip-github-actions-ci-to-run-on-push&quot;&gt;How to skip GitHub actions CI to run on push&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometime if you want to just update the project documents like readme file etc. and push your code and you do not want to run the entire CI to build, test and deploy etc. Then use the trick use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[skip CI]&lt;/code&gt; in your commit comments. Also add the filter in your workflow template to not run build when &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[skip CI]&lt;/code&gt; text present in commit comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add below expression in your workflow template:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;!contains(github.event.head_commit.message,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&apos;[skip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;CI]&apos;)&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rupeshtiwari/coding-examples-final-450-by-love-babbar/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yaml&quot;&gt;Check my template file&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is example to skip ci build in GitHub actions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;chore: updating readme [skip CI]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See my CI build did not run&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4SixDmE.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this article is helpful for all beginners for GitHub actions and node.js like me!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I am happy that I cleared my Microsoft Azure Fundamental Certification (Az 900) Exam. This is the start of my Azure journey. In this article, I will explain what I did?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div data-iframe-width=&quot;150&quot; data-iframe-height=&quot;270&quot; data-share-badge-id=&quot;3c6d3cd0-842d-4b00-bc7c-8ff9c9f6a17c&quot; data-share-badge-host=&quot;https://www.credly.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-motivate-yourself&quot;&gt;How to Motivate yourself?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to go out of you comfort zone and do something is the most challenging work. You have to keep yourself motivated that is the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mantra&lt;/code&gt; and also difficult work. Many people loose their heart and stop working towards their goal. So I would ask you to first find your inspiration behind the work that you are doing. Find/discover why you want to do/become something? Get their answers and stick to it. Whenever you get de-motivated read the answers that you discovered before starting your journey and motivate yourself. Or find out new motivation to work again and get going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very important thing is to keep yourself motivated to prepare and give exams. Specially, when you are a working professional and having married with family and kids. You will be almost busy with work and family and seldom get chance to carve out time to learn new things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what and how I did? Well, I am getting up at 5 AM (yes sacrificing my favorite sleep) and scheduling my studies accordingly. I used to learn Azure in the morning time before my office starts. Like I said you have to keep yourself motivated and find your inspiration. In order to keep my-self motivated, I am reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Vivekananda&quot;&gt;Swami Vivekananda&lt;/a&gt;. One of his best quotes that I remember is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Whatever you believe, that you will be. There is nothing to obstruct you!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So find-out your motivation and keep yourself inspired and keep working towards upgrading your IT skills or goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;will-az-900-exam-certification-expires&quot;&gt;Will AZ-900 exam certification expires?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good part of exam AZ-900 is it never expires. It will remain in your profile forever as valid certificate. Other role based Azure exams will expire every 2 year or so. However, you can give renewal exam that is free of cost to update your certificates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-should-i-read-for-preparing-az-900-exam&quot;&gt;What should I read for preparing Az 900 exam?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best resource for me was &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900&quot;&gt;Microsoft Azure on-line free courses for Az 900&lt;/a&gt;. You should finish that course first which is divided in 6 parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;azure-fundamentals-certification-az-900&quot;&gt;Azure Fundamentals Certification (AZ 900)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Azure Fundamentals&lt;/strong&gt; certification needs 6 part to be finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Part 1: Describe core Azure concepts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Part 2: Describe core Azure services&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Part 3: Describe core solutions and management tools on Azure&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Part 4: Describe general security and network security features&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Part 5: Describe identity, governance, privacy, and compliance features&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Part 6: Describe Azure cost management and service level agreements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/ulz9JTX.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you finish your on-line course you will receive badges from Microsoft like I got.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/tlA7Tod.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;solve-question-answers-given-after-each-module&quot;&gt;Solve Question Answers given after each module&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After finishing each module from on-line Microsoft learning material. You will be asked questions. Make sure you give them to concrete your understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sample Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/eWmqFtn.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will see success message after giving answers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5BQwsxD.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next it will route you for next learning module&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/DduTHOf.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;read-previous-az-900-exam-questions&quot;&gt;Read previous Az 900 exam questions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For any exam you must first understand the concepts plus you must also remember couple of concepts and answers. Yes!, you must have to remember or learn by-heart few things. There is no short-cut 😃. This is very important step. Let’s discuss how I prepared?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you remember in our college days. We used to attain daily class lecture and understand the concepts. However, before exam we used to first understand and prepare all the previous year questions and then go for exam. The same strategy I followed. I finished my homework by reading concepts from Microsoft on-line free training. Then I found many free resources to get previous Az-900 questions and learn them. I prepared &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.exam-answer.com/microsoft/az-900&quot;&gt;from this link&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.examtopics.com/exams/microsoft/az-900/&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;. I also took paid service to practice for exam ( this is not compulsory for you ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;finally-you-will-schedule-for-exam&quot;&gt;Finally You will schedule for &lt;strong&gt;exam&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scheduling exam is an on-line process. You have to pay $99 as of today this is the fee. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900&quot;&gt;Here is the link&lt;/a&gt; to schedule for Az-900. As much possible try for going to give exam in center or lab. I tried to avoid from home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nfTKBXd.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;exam-from-home-or-center&quot;&gt;Exam from home or Center?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I choose to go to center (lab) for exam. You could choose to give exam from home. However, there are many restrictions when you give from home and I was not that comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-the-exam-center&quot;&gt;In the exam center&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you go to the exam center. First thing you need to fill form where you write in time, your name and exam name. Then you will be asked 2 ID proof I provided one my Driving License and the other proof I gave my credit card. Then she took my picture and gave mea locker key, A small white board (made of paper) with marker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is me standing in-front of my exam building facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cga6FTg.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was supposed to put all belongings like (mobile, watch, keys, cards) inside the locker. Then I entered in the exam room with Mask (mandatory).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure 900 exam was 48 minutes and 38 questions. I attempted all questions since there was no negative marking. Well I finished my exam within 20 minutes since it won’t take exam 48 mins to finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-will-get-score-immediately&quot;&gt;You will get score immediately&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good part is you will get you score after completing exam. My score is 950.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/dSZs0ah.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;download-certificate&quot;&gt;Download certificate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next you can go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/dashboard.aspx&quot;&gt;Microsoft Certificate Dashboard&lt;/a&gt; and download your certificate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div data-iframe-width=&quot;150&quot; data-iframe-height=&quot;270&quot; data-share-badge-id=&quot;3c6d3cd0-842d-4b00-bc7c-8ff9c9f6a17c&quot; data-share-badge-host=&quot;https://www.credly.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Azure Security Center&lt;/strong&gt; is the base infrastructure service to collect logs analyze them and generate tailored recommendations. Learn how can you review and fix &lt;strong&gt;general&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;cloud&lt;/strong&gt; securities and manage security concerns of your resources in Azure. This article will help you to prepare for &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-303&quot;&gt;az-303: Microsoft Azure Architect Technologies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/HzMy9LY.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Azure Security center&lt;/strong&gt; is a unified infrastructure security management system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is your “&lt;strong&gt;base layer&lt;/strong&gt;” for monitoring the &lt;strong&gt;security&lt;/strong&gt; configuration and &lt;strong&gt;health&lt;/strong&gt; of your workloads. Azure Security Center collects events from &lt;strong&gt;Azure&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;log analytics agents&lt;/strong&gt; and correlates them in a &lt;strong&gt;security analytics engine&lt;/strong&gt;, to provide you with tailored recommendations (hardening tasks). Strengthening your security posture can be achieved by implementing these &lt;strong&gt;recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Azure Security Center uses a built-in Azure Policy initiative in audit-only mode (the Azure Security Benchmark) as well as Azure Monitor logs and other Azure security solutions like Microsoft Cloud App Security. &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/itops-talk-blog/what-s-the-difference-between-azure-security-center-azure/ba-p/2155188&quot;&gt;Learn more here…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;security-challenges&quot;&gt;Security Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In cloud &lt;strong&gt;workloads are changing quickly&lt;/strong&gt; and we must make sure the developers/devops are following the security best practices while provisioning the resources.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Internet &lt;strong&gt;Security attacks&lt;/strong&gt; risk is always there if your resources are internet facing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Also Security &lt;strong&gt;skills are less&lt;/strong&gt; with developers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;solving-security-challenges&quot;&gt;Solving Security Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen Security Posture&lt;/strong&gt;: Using Azure Security Monitor you can examine your resources and give you security reports.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protect against threats&lt;/strong&gt;: Azure security monitor can generate security alerts and raises threat prevention suggestions on your Azure resources.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Auto Secure&lt;/strong&gt;: You can give auto-provisioning to resolve security issues faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;resources-protected-by-azure-security-center&quot;&gt;Resources Protected by Azure Security Center&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of resources which are automatically &lt;strong&gt;protected and monitor&lt;/strong&gt; by security center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All &lt;strong&gt;Azure PaaS resources&lt;/strong&gt; like DB engine and Storage accounts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Azure&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Virtual Machines&lt;/strong&gt; on cloud or on premises. You must install Log Analytics Agents on them ( both windows and Linux ) supported.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Azure VMs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security alerts&lt;/strong&gt; are created when threat is found on the &lt;strong&gt;azure workloads&lt;/strong&gt;. One has to investigate the security alerts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secure Score&lt;/strong&gt;- over all health score&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulatory compliance&lt;/strong&gt; - how compliant you are for the resources.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Azure Defender&lt;/strong&gt; - protects resources against security threats.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Firewall Manager&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations-screen&quot;&gt;Recommendations screen&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/UJit8lQ.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
Displays the Secure Score, security improvement for all resources &amp;amp; their &lt;strong&gt;recommendation&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Quick fixes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;security-alerts&quot;&gt;Security alerts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/UJit8lQ.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is any security threats found on your resources then you will see alerts here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cloud-security&quot;&gt;Cloud security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/UJit8lQ.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
Here you can see secure score and check your overall health score plus you can visit the recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Do you have node.js project that you want to write specs using Jasmine? Are you wondering how to write specs and run all specs in your node.js project? Lets answer all of this in this article so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-up-jasmine-in-nodejs&quot;&gt;Setting up Jasmine in node.js&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to write specs for your project the best option is to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Jasmine&lt;/code&gt;. So do not delay and just install &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jasmine&lt;/code&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-cli&quot;&gt;# Run below script

npm i -D jasmine
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can write your node.js with some specs over there just like below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;reverseWord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;word&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;word&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;reversed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;idx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;idx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;idx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;reversed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;word&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;idx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;reversed&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// This is the spec written in Jasmin BDD style&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;reverseWord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;test #1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;reverseWord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Geeks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toBe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;skeeG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;test #1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;reverseWord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toBe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;rof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-run-the-jasmine-specs-in-nodejs-project&quot;&gt;How to run the Jasmine specs in Node.js project?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well you can use jasmine cli or javascript to run jasmine specs. Read this article to learn &lt;a href=&quot;https://jasmine.github.io/setup/nodejs.html&quot;&gt;how to run specs in node.js&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you want to debug your specs in Chrome browser. Then I would recommend use 3rd party test runner. So I choose &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;karma&lt;/code&gt;. It is a test runner that will give you script to run all the specs in your project smoothly and you can debug them too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-setup-karma-in-nodejs-project&quot;&gt;How to setup karma in Node.js project?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karma official document has nice steps to follow and install karma in your node.js project &lt;a href=&quot;http://karma-runner.github.io/6.3/intro/installation.html&quot;&gt;please read them here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I followed below steps to setup karma in my node.js project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-1-installing-karma-plugins&quot;&gt;Step 1: Installing Karma plugins&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-cli&quot;&gt;# Install Karma:
npm install karma --save-dev

# Install plugins that your project needs:
npm install karma-jasmine karma-chrome-launcher jasmine-core --save-dev

# Run below then, you can run Karma simply by karma from anywhere and it will always run the local version.
npm install -g karma-cli
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-2-creating-karma-configuration-file&quot;&gt;Step 2: Creating Karma Configuration file&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-3-add-reporters-to-show-spec-result-text-in-chrome-browser&quot;&gt;Step 3: Add reporters to show spec result text in Chrome browser&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to follow below steps to show your spec text in chrome browser:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;view-karma-test-output-in-a-chrome-browser-steps&quot;&gt;View Karma Test Output in a Chrome Browser Steps&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;view-karma-test-output-in-a-chrome-browser&quot;&gt;View Karma Test Output in a Chrome Browser?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install npm i -D karma-jasmine-html-reporter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;karma.conf.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;add &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&apos;kjhtml&apos;&lt;/code&gt; in your reporter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;add client:{clearContext:false}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-json highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;reporters:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&apos;progress&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&apos;kjhtml&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;client:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;clearContext:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rupeshtiwari/coding-examples-final-450-by-love-babbar/blob/main/karma.conf.js&quot;&gt;Example file for karma.conf.js&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-4-starting-karma-and-running-specs&quot;&gt;Step 4: Starting Karma and running specs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add below script in your npm package scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to run your specs on chrome browser and watch your files and auto refresh specs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-json highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;test&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;karma start karma.conf.js&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just run once your node.js specs in ChromeHeadless browser without watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-json highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;test:once&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;karma start --single-run --browsers ChromeHeadless karma.conf.js&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-all-nodejs-specs-locally&quot;&gt;Run all node.js specs locally&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets run specs &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm run test&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/b6sfxP0.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hurray! 💯 my specs are running and it is watching too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets test in without watch mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm run test:once&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/iLT4CoL.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hurray! 💯 again tests are working. Superb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did it our project is setup and enjoy writing specs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rupeshtiwari/coding-examples-final-450-by-love-babbar&quot;&gt;Here is my node.js project&lt;/a&gt; that has jasmine and karma setup.
If you enjoy this project please press the star button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next step is how to run these specs in GitHub when we push the code? This I will explore in my next blog so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy coding and be happy!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;​This article will teach you t​he how to configure and implement &lt;strong&gt;diagnostics log&lt;/strong&gt; for Azure resources. This article will help you to prepare for &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-303&quot;&gt;az-303: Microsoft Azure Architect Technologies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implement and Monitor an Azure Infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt; is 50-55% in Az-303. Under &lt;strong&gt;Implement cloud infrastructure monitoring&lt;/strong&gt; we have below topics to cover:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;az-303&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;azure&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;monitor security&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Azure Security Center&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;monitor performance&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Azure Monitor Metrics&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;monitor health and availability&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Azure Monitor&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;monitor cost&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Cost Management &amp;amp; Azure Adviser&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;configure advanced logging&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;App Insights &amp;amp; Log Analytics&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;configure logging for workloads Initiate automated responses by using Action Groups&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;configure and manage advanced alerts&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implementing-infrastructure-monitoring-with-azure-monitor-&quot;&gt;Implementing Infrastructure Monitoring with Azure Monitor 🐒&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will use &lt;strong&gt;Azure Platform Logs&lt;/strong&gt; to get the detail logs of the Azure resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;azure-platform-logs&quot;&gt;Azure Platform Logs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Provides detailed &lt;strong&gt;diagnostics&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;auditing&lt;/strong&gt; information for Azure resources and the Azure platform they depend on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;types-of-platform-logs&quot;&gt;Types of Platform Logs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure platform logs are of 2 types:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Activity Logs&lt;/strong&gt;: This works on &lt;strong&gt;subscription&lt;/strong&gt; level. Who did what and when can be seen here. Example who deleted Azure blob container or Azure Key Vault etc. You can check all of the write operations here.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resource Logs&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;Created for each individual resource&lt;/strong&gt;. You can get logs like who was trying to fetch secretes from &lt;strong&gt;Azure vault Instance&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;destinations-of-logs&quot;&gt;Destinations of Logs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the &lt;strong&gt;Diagnostic settings&lt;/strong&gt; to configure Azure Resources to write platform logs to different destinations. &lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/31ZUgS4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/Bsl9lSA.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
Logs can send to below places:
&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/zVHJ9NF.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Log Analytics Workspace&lt;/strong&gt;: Analyze logs using &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/tutorial?pivots=azuredataexplorer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kusto queries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Azure Data Explorer. Leverage &lt;strong&gt;Alerts&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Visualizations&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Archive to Storage Account&lt;/strong&gt;: Cheaper option so you can keep your log for long time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stream to an event hub&lt;/strong&gt;: To stream logs to external systems. Example: security information &amp;amp; event management software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;destination-requirements&quot;&gt;Destination Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In order to log at &lt;strong&gt;Analytics Workspace&lt;/strong&gt; make sure you put both workspace and resource instance at the &lt;strong&gt;same region&lt;/strong&gt;. This gives performance also.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For streaming to &lt;strong&gt;Event Hubs&lt;/strong&gt; you need &lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Listen&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Manage&lt;/strong&gt; permissions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For &lt;strong&gt;storage account log&lt;/strong&gt;. Create new storage account for log only don’t put other data in this. So that you have good control over logs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;demo-configure-logging&quot;&gt;Demo Configure Logging&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will create &lt;strong&gt;Analytics Workspace, Azure Storage Account and Event Hub&lt;/strong&gt; for logging our &lt;strong&gt;Azure Function Resource&lt;/strong&gt;. Next we will configure the Diagnostics Settings to write logs to all of the above destinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;creating-log-storage-account&quot;&gt;Creating Log Storage Account&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/qnL9pT0.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
First create Azure storage for logging at the same region as your Azure resource exist. Sign in to the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com and follow steps.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/mjyQ79X.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;creating-log-analytics-workspace&quot;&gt;Creating Log Analytics Workspace&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Log Analytics workspace provides:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;Geographic Location&lt;/strong&gt; for the &lt;strong&gt;data storage&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data isolation&lt;/strong&gt; by granting different users access rights following one of our recommended design strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scope for configuration&lt;/strong&gt; of settings like pricing tier, retention, and data capping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/Uma4T5m.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
Let’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/quick-create-workspace&quot;&gt;create a workspace for Analytics Workspace logs&lt;/a&gt;. When you create workspace in the &lt;strong&gt;same region&lt;/strong&gt; as the Azure resources it manages then there is &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;outbound data transfer charges&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;configure-diagnostic-setting-to-send-logs-to-analytics-workspace-and-azure-storage&quot;&gt;Configure Diagnostic Setting to send logs To Analytics Workspace and Azure storage&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next let’s find our azure function and create diagnostic settings to send the log to Analytics Workspace and Storage Account together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/gqzGN86.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;creating-event-hub-for-logging&quot;&gt;Creating Event Hub for Logging&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sign in to the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com and follow steps:
&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/wMdGcUo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📓 Make sure you give Shared access policy as &lt;strong&gt;Manage, Send and Listen&lt;/strong&gt; to the Event Hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;configure-diagnostic-setting-to-send-logs-to-event-hub&quot;&gt;Configure Diagnostic Setting to send logs to Event Hub&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sign in to the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com and follow steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/DnfeA4b.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Webbooks are basically user defined HTTP callbacks which are triggered by specific events. Whenever that trigger event occurs in the source site, the webhook receives the event, collects the data, and sends it to the URL specified by you in the form of an HTTP request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like in Pub/Sub architecture one handler subscribes an event. Once we publish the event the handler gets executed. Similarly in webhook, instead of publishing event we call webhook HTTP POST URL on certain event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example would be suppose, you have your Github Repo. Whenever someone star it you want to HTTP post a message to your Discord Server. In this example GitHub will call webhook URL by sending payload with HTTP POST method. You can implement a server to receive the HTTP POST call and send message to Discord. Or you can also use Discord webhook URL to directly use in GitHub and you do not need to write a code, automatically GitHub payload will be displayed in Discord server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/61FAXpr.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn Mocking Webhook&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creating local Webhook using express&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Integrate local Webhook with GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Integrate Twilio serverless function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visit this read me &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rupeshtiwari.com/coding-examples-webhook-sample-app/&quot;&gt;here as well&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;webhook-mocking-for-testing&quot;&gt;Webhook mocking for testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create mocked Webhook handler at here https://beeceptor.com/ for testing and playing around. Create Webhook in beeceptor. And use this newly created webhook in your GitHub repo to see how Webhooks are called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-webhook-in-discord&quot;&gt;Create Webhook in Discord&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/dF4wgPK.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copy the URL and append &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/github&lt;/code&gt; and add this URL in the GitHub Webhook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/h1PL0Qc.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;writing-our-own-local-server-for-webhook&quot;&gt;Writing our own local server for Webhook&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we write our own server to post to discord Webhook.
Check &lt;a href=&quot;express-discorder/package.json&quot;&gt;this project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm start&lt;/code&gt; to start your local web server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mmAjIdZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lets-expose-local-server-to-internet&quot;&gt;Let’s expose local server to internet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ngrock&lt;/code&gt; is a npm package that converts your local server to public URL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;setting-up-ngrok-in-local-window-machine&quot;&gt;Setting up &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ngrok&lt;/code&gt; in local window machine?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ngrok.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ngrok&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; opens up tunnel to local machine. So that your application can be publicly accessible through the tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now our local server is running at http://localhost:3000&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets install &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ngrok&lt;/code&gt; and open this port for internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ngrok&lt;/code&gt; and run the exe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add ngrok.exe path in the system environment so that you can access from anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/DLRVAgw.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;creating-public-url-using-ngrok&quot;&gt;Creating public URL using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ngrok&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will expose local server over internet by getting brand new internet URL.
Open powershell run below script to expose localhost:3000 to public internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-powershell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ngrok&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;3000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xbmFDKj.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My local server is accessible over internet and I get http and https both URLs available to browse over internet&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next I can visit my URL over internet&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/q0wF6aM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hooking-up-local-server-with-github&quot;&gt;Hooking up local server with GitHub&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now in your github you can go and add the Webhook URL that you generated just now. Make sure to append &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/github&lt;/code&gt; on your URL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/C0A8KNI.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if you start github repo you will receive the message to your discord channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/61FAXpr.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can visit the Webhook payloads at this address http://localhost:4040/inspect/http from &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ngrok&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rupeshtiwari/coding-examples-webhook-sample-app/commit/e81078d4a4bc5c64a2b4d59471d4d2a89eee168c&quot;&gt;code so far&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-lets-read-the-avtar-url-from-github-payload&quot;&gt;Next lets read the Avtar URL from Github payload&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we star/un-star we can read the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;avtar_url&lt;/code&gt; of the user and show that in discord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-start-your-local-server-in-watch-mode&quot;&gt;How to start your local server in watch mode?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm i nodemon -g&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nodemon start&lt;/code&gt; to start your server in watch mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/64T50Md.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can notice that we are able to post the avatar of the user from github to our discord channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0e5qmWY.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;avatarUrl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sender&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;avatar_url&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rupeshtiwari/coding-examples-webhook-sample-app/commit/a7ac2e96c3e1280cb0b77f4ebfa8beb007253cb1&quot;&gt;source code so far&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;twilio&quot;&gt;Twilio&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twilio is a serverless solution that can respond to SMS coming to a virtual phone number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a flow in Twilio to speak up when someone calls you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IJ2u1lm.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;record-voicemail-and-send-to-webhook&quot;&gt;Record voicemail and send to Webhook&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can record voicemail, convert voice to text&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/SB8bWeq.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And use Webhook URL to send the transcript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hWXuQbe.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can install &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Twilio-CLI&lt;/code&gt; globally to send messages from your local development machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm i -g twilio-cli&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next login to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;twilio&lt;/code&gt; by running &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;twilio login&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kSiPNqU.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run below script&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;twilio plugins:install @twilio-labs/plugin-serverless
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-twilio-project&quot;&gt;Creating Twilio project&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create project&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;twilio serverless:init ideacatcher --empty
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run project&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;twilio serverless:start
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navigate to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://localhost:3000/send-test&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your server is up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/JFMfcgB.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Azure Service Bus&lt;/strong&gt; is a transport layer comprises of messaging entities. Learn what is &lt;strong&gt;Topology&lt;/strong&gt; in messaging world and how N-Service bus makes life easy by giving built-in configurations for creating topologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;messaging-entities&quot;&gt;Messaging Entities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;queue&quot;&gt;Queue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Queues offer &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;First In, First Out (FIFO)&lt;/code&gt; message delivery to one or more competing consumers. That is, receivers typically receive and process messages in the order in which they &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;were added to the queue&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/PfN2VDK.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can create queues using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, or Resource Manager templates&lt;/code&gt;. Then, send and receive messages using clients written in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;C#, Java, Python, JavaScript, PHP, and Ruby&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;topic&quot;&gt;Topic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Topic is just like a virtual queue where messages are pushed and get broad-casted to multiple receivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;subscription&quot;&gt;Subscription&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subscription has one virtual input queue via that it receives a specific message and executes the receivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Topics and subscriptions provide a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;one-to-many&lt;/code&gt; form of communication in a publish and subscribe pattern. It’s useful for scaling to large numbers of recipients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/EqW5y1K.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;messaging-patterns&quot;&gt;Messaging Patterns&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;consumerproducer-pattern&quot;&gt;Consumer/Producer Pattern&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you send a message to a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Queue&lt;/code&gt; and if there is any &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Function&lt;/code&gt; listening to the queue gets triggered and they execute the function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can treat these kind of messages as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;command&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pubsub-pattern&quot;&gt;Pub/Sub Pattern&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have an &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;event&lt;/code&gt; that has to be consumed by &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;multiple systems&lt;/code&gt;. Then we should consider using Pub/Sub pattern. It helps you to create loosely coupled, scalable architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Topic&lt;/code&gt; few subscribers are listening to that topic with some filter rule. Then if you publish an event to that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Topic&lt;/code&gt;. Then subscribers will receive the event if the rules are satisfied.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/5t4MGUZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;requestreply-pattern&quot;&gt;Request/Reply Pattern&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Request/Reply&lt;/code&gt; pattern is also treated as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Producer/Consumer&lt;/code&gt; pattern. If you are working with distributed architecture including cloud. Then it is difficult to do synchronous actions. However, using Request/Reply pattern you can work just like synchronous operation.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/hCR7iki.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
Example: Suppose you have UI says create order and once order is created you must show order-id in the UI. We will use Azure Function and Azure Service Bus in order to Achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will create &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Azure Function-1&lt;/code&gt; to trigger by &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Http&lt;/code&gt; request. Then it will send a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;message&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Queue&lt;/code&gt; and you will write another &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Azure Function-2&lt;/code&gt; to get triggered by the Queue &amp;amp; execute the use case. However, once the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Function-2&lt;/code&gt; is done it will &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;reply back&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Function-1&lt;/code&gt;. Finally the result will be returned back to the UI/Client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the pseudo code for above example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-csharp highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;HttpGet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;orders/create&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;IActionResult&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;CreateOrder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Order&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;order&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;requestReplyService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Ok&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Request/Reply&lt;/code&gt; is not the same as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Request/Response&lt;/code&gt;. Request/Reply is usually associated with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;asynchronous&lt;/code&gt; messages while Request/Response with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;web&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Request/Reply&lt;/code&gt; to work, both the sender and the receiver require a designated queue. There is a dedicated handler and receiver for a message Request/Reply.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;topology&quot;&gt;Topology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Messaging topology&lt;/strong&gt; is a specific arrangement of the messaging entities, such as queues, topics, subscriptions, and rules. &lt;strong&gt;Azure Service Bus transport&lt;/strong&gt; operates on a topology created on the &lt;strong&gt;broker&lt;/strong&gt;. Topology handles exchanging &lt;strong&gt;messages between endpoints&lt;/strong&gt;, by creating and configuring Azure Service Bus entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;types-of-topologies&quot;&gt;Types of Topologies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure Service Bus Topology one has to create manually. If you are using N-Service Bus then you get 2 built-in topologies out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;EndpointOrientedTopology&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ForwardingTopology (recommended👍)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both topologies create a &lt;strong&gt;single input queue per endpoint&lt;/strong&gt; and implement &lt;strong&gt;Publish-Subscribe mechanism&lt;/strong&gt;. No default topology is set by the Azure Service Bus transport. Topology has to be explicitly configured using &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.particular.net/transports/azure-service-bus/legacy/configuration/full&quot;&gt;configuration API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn more about all &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.particular.net/transports/azure-service-bus/legacy/topologies#:~:text=Forwarding%20topology&amp;amp;text=Subscriptions%20are%20created%20under%20topic,decoupling%20between%20publishers%20and%20subscribers.&quot;&gt;Topologies here.&lt;/a&gt;. Pre-built topology is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ForwardingTopology&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;endpoint-oriented-topology&quot;&gt;Endpoint Oriented Topology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;endpoint-oriented&lt;/code&gt; topology defines a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;queue&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;topic&lt;/code&gt; per &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;endpoint&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/i3VofMU.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a publisher raises an event, it is published to the publisher topic. Then the subscription entities filter events using the associated rules. Finally, the subscriber endpoint pulls events for processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The example below demonstrates a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;publisher&lt;/code&gt; called &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Publisher&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;subscriber&lt;/code&gt; called &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Subscriber&lt;/code&gt;. Publisher can raise two events, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;EventA&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;EventB&lt;/code&gt;. The Subscriber subscribes to both events and two subscription entities are created, one per event type. Each subscription entity filters out events using a rule associated with the subscription.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t prefer this topology because In order to subscribe to an event, the subscriber must know the publishing endpoint’s name, causing coupling between publisher and subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;forwarding-topology&quot;&gt;Forwarding Topology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forwarding topology defines a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;queue&lt;/code&gt; per &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;endpoint&lt;/code&gt; and a shared &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;topic&lt;/code&gt; to do the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;publishing&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ForwardingTopology&lt;/code&gt; was introduced to take advantage of the &lt;strong&gt;broker nature of the Azure Service Bus&lt;/strong&gt; and to leverage its native capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure Service Bus has facility to forward a event from a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Subscription&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Queue&lt;/code&gt;. We will use this technique to setup this topology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/638DjGm.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In above example &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Subscriptions&lt;/code&gt; are created under topic &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle&lt;/code&gt; with one subscription entity per subscribing endpoint. Each subscription contains multiple rules; there’s one rule per event type that the subscribing endpoint is interested in. This enables a complete decoupling between publishers and subscribers. All messages received by subscription are forwarded to the input queue of the subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For N-Service Bus this is the recommended option for all new projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle-1&lt;/code&gt; is the topic created by N-Service Bus. &lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/s8ilrE0.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle-1&lt;/code&gt; has &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Subscriptions&lt;/code&gt; across the endpoints and each Subscription has &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Rules&lt;/code&gt;. Rules are the filters defined by the subscribers and once the Rule satisfied then only message arrives to the subscriber. Whenever, receiver defines the filter in the source code then only the rules are created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
📦Topics
 └ 📂bundle-1
 │ └ 📂Subscribers
 │ │ ├ 📂Subscriber.Endpoint1
 │ │ │ └ 📂Rules
 │ │ │ │ └ 📜$default 👈FalseFilter Rule 1=0
 │ │ └ 📂Subscriber.Endpoint2
 │ │ │ └ 📂Rules
 │ │ │ │ ├ 📜$default
 │ │ │ │ └ 📜only-prime 👈Custom Rule
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever message will comes to a Topic that runs to the rules of each subscriber of the endpoint. And if the message has prime number then it will only go to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Endpoint2&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;only-prime&lt;/code&gt; subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this arrangement of Topic, Subscription, Queue and Rules are called Forwarding Topology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Azure Concept&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;N-Service Bus Concept&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Topic&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;End Point&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Azure Function&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Message Handler&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-n-service-bus-did&quot;&gt;What N-Service Bus Did?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;N-Service bus has &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;enableInstaller&lt;/code&gt; method once you call it. Then N-Service Bus creates &lt;strong&gt;Forwarding Topology&lt;/strong&gt; and does below for a given endpoint:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creates a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Topic&lt;/code&gt; with name &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creates &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Subscription&lt;/code&gt; for that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;topic&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creates default Rule in the message of the subscription with default condition &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;FalseFilter Rule&lt;/code&gt; i.e. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1=0&lt;/code&gt;. So that message will not satisfy this rule by default any all events will not arrive to this endpoint.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creates a input queue for the endpoint. Subscription forwards the message to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Input Queue&lt;/code&gt; of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;endpoint&lt;/code&gt; once Rules get satisfied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;endpoint&lt;/code&gt; is N-Service Bus concept that is coupled to Azure Service Bus &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Queue&lt;/code&gt;. Using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;endpoint&lt;/code&gt; you can either send or receive messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--danger&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-info-circle&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Important&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
N-Service Bus is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; able to create the &lt;strong&gt;topology&lt;/strong&gt; when it is hosted on the Azure Function &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;as of now&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Learn how you can do by &lt;a href=&quot;https://weblogs.asp.net/sfeldman/automatic-nservicebus-topology-creation-for-function&quot;&gt;your own topology setup in Azure Function here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-azure-service-bus-namespace&quot;&gt;Creating Azure Service Bus Namespace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s create Azure service bus namespace from the Azure portal. &lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/ZUdj70X.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get the connection string and open the connection string on the Azure Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;service-bus-explorer&quot;&gt;Service Bus Explorer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can download the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/paolosalvatori/ServiceBusExplorer/releases&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Service Bus Explorer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; an open source windows UI that helps us to visualize the Topologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connect to your Azure Service Bus Namespace by using connection string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/PYOY7fj.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--info&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-info-circle&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;N-Service Bus&lt;/strong&gt; helps us to retrieve the message and search for subscriber and invoke the handle method of the Handler. All of this code is already written in N-Service Bus. That helps a lot when you are working with Azure Service Bus Transport. I recommend using N-Service Bus.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Learn Merge Sorting algorithm in recursion function. In this article I will show you the execution of the recursion function for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Merge Sorting&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;merge-sort&quot;&gt;Merge sort&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merge sort is one of the most powerful sorting algorithm. Mozilla, Firefox, Chrome and many browser by default most of the time uses &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Merge Sort&lt;/code&gt; for sorting an array. You should learn &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Merge sort&lt;/code&gt; algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;complexity-analysis&quot;&gt;Complexity Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time complexity&lt;/strong&gt; = &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;O(nlogn)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space complexity&lt;/strong&gt; = &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;O(n)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;merge-sort-implementation-coding&quot;&gt;Merge Sort Implementation Coding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/roopkt/pen/ExWRRgP?editors=0010&quot;&gt;exercise file&lt;/a&gt; for you to implement merge sort. First try by your own.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/roopkt/pen/ZEeMPPL&quot;&gt;answer file&lt;/a&gt; for merge sort &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;un-optimized&lt;/code&gt; version.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/roopkt/pen/yLMQvbv?editors=0010&quot;&gt;answer file&lt;/a&gt; for merge sort space &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;optimized&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;in-place&lt;/code&gt; array sorting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merge sort algorithm code shared in gist also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-by-step-explanation-for-recursive-merge-sort-algorithm&quot;&gt;Step by Step explanation for Recursive Merge Sort Algorithm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function will call the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mergeSort&lt;/code&gt; with entire given array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7297c2D.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/JsR9WiT.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1st&lt;/code&gt; Recursion call to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mergeSort&lt;/code&gt; with left part of the array &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[2,4,1,6]&lt;/code&gt; and pause the function execution at line &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;number-7&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hHS3xNl.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;2nd&lt;/code&gt; recursion call with Array &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[2, 4]&lt;/code&gt; and pervious function pauses at line &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;number -7&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/phJfnSY.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;3rd&lt;/code&gt; recursion call with array &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/code&gt; and previous function pauses at line &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;number-7&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/eIa9tQY.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resume 2nd recursion call with array &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[2,4]&lt;/code&gt; and call merge sort with right part &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/E4lHVoS.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;3rd&lt;/code&gt; recursion call with array &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/code&gt; and previous function pauses at line &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;number -8&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BPGqO9K.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This function will exit since length is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;less than 2&lt;/code&gt;. Therefore, 3rd recursion call resumes and executes at line &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;number-9&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qRlvs1g.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is a call to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;stitch&lt;/code&gt; method which will join both left and right array and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;re-order&lt;/code&gt; them in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ascending&lt;/code&gt; order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Sac57Mq.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resume &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;2nd&lt;/code&gt; recursion method at line &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;number-7&lt;/code&gt; and call &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mergeSort&lt;/code&gt; with right part of the array &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[1,6]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EDo7OuL.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pause the function at line &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;numnber-7&lt;/code&gt; and call &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mergeSort&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/code&gt; which will exit because of base condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IWO421x.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Function resume at line &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;numnber-7&lt;/code&gt; and execute line &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;number-8&lt;/code&gt; call &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mergeSort&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Et0NceF.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mergeSort&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/code&gt; will exit because of base condition. Next function will resume at line &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;number-9&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;stitch&lt;/code&gt; method will call that will re-order array &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[1,6]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IqzLMOY.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next Resume &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1st&lt;/code&gt; recursion at line &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;number-7&lt;/code&gt; and execute &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mergeSort&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[8,5,3,7]&lt;/code&gt;. Next function will pause at line &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;number-7&lt;/code&gt; and will call &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mergeSort&lt;/code&gt; recursively with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[8,5]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4nkvxgp.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next first it will make &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mergeSort&lt;/code&gt; with [8] and pause at line &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;number-7&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/tgRaKe4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next It will pause the previous function at line &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;number-7&lt;/code&gt;. And Resume at line &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;number-8&lt;/code&gt; and call &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mergeSort&lt;/code&gt; recursively with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/code&gt; and pause again at line &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;number-8&lt;/code&gt;, which will exit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yF0Dmqm.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, function will resume at line &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;number-8&lt;/code&gt; and execute &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;stitch&lt;/code&gt; to sort the array. Hence the array will become &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[5,8]&lt;/code&gt; and exit the function. The previous function resumes at line &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;number-7&lt;/code&gt; and call &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mergeSort&lt;/code&gt; recursively with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[3,7]&lt;/code&gt; and pauses at line &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;number-9&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kEnaF5C.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, it will call &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mergeSort&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/code&gt; recursively then pause at line &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;number-7&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6Bb8EZy.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mergeSort&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/code&gt; will exit and then previous function will resume again at &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;number-7&lt;/code&gt; and execute next line which will call &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mergeSort&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/code&gt; recursively then pauses at line &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;number-8&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mergeSort&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/code&gt; exit function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kZ1hvzE.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then previous function will resume again at &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;number-8&lt;/code&gt; and execute next line &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;stitch&lt;/code&gt; function that will sort the array in ascending order to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[3,7]&lt;/code&gt; and exit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xyLPW86.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1st&lt;/code&gt; iteration function will resume at line &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;number-9&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;stitch&lt;/code&gt; the array &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[5,8]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[3,7]&lt;/code&gt; and reorder the array &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[3,5,7,8]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bZgzA0b.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1st&lt;/code&gt; function will resume at line &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;number-8&lt;/code&gt; and call &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;stitch&lt;/code&gt; method to re-order the array &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]&lt;/code&gt; and finally exit.
This way you get the sorted array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xBTClXY.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorting is done! however let me explain you the stitch algorithm which is the core part or merge sort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;merge-sort-stitch-algorithm&quot;&gt;Merge sort Stitch algorithm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might have noticed that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MergeSort&lt;/code&gt; Method is calling stitch at every recursion method. Now I will explain the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;stitch&lt;/code&gt; function to you. This is the algorithm that takes &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;left&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;right&lt;/code&gt; and original array. Then it will re-order the original array in ascending order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;stitch&lt;/code&gt; algorithm code used for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;merge&lt;/code&gt; sort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/1de701d2a201dda405ea701ab0030d5b.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First compare left with right array 1st element. 1 is less than 3 so copy 1 at &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A[0]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QgcDEkf.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next compare 2 in left array with 3 in Right array. Since 2 is less than 3. Copy 2 at &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A[1]&lt;/code&gt;. Increment left and A array indices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/EVK7a8N.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next compare 4 in left array with 3 in right array and since 4 is more than 3. Copy 4 to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A[2]&lt;/code&gt; and increment A and R array indices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HyNtQhv.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next compare &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;4&lt;/code&gt; in left array with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;5&lt;/code&gt; in Right array. Since &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;4&lt;/code&gt; is less than &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;5&lt;/code&gt;. Copy &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;4&lt;/code&gt; at &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A[3]&lt;/code&gt;. Increment &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;left&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; array indices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/D40d5Ti.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next compare &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;6&lt;/code&gt; in left array with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;5&lt;/code&gt; in right array and since &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;6&lt;/code&gt; is more than &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;5&lt;/code&gt;. Copy &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;5&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A[4]&lt;/code&gt; and increment A and R array indices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5sn4Kvx.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next iterate over &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;left&lt;/code&gt; array and copy remaining elements at Array &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; and increment both indices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TwgMpfB.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, iterate over &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;right&lt;/code&gt; array and copy remaining elements at Array &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; and increment both indices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ju1SPTW.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Azure Solutions Architect &lt;strong&gt;Expert&lt;/strong&gt; is a role-based certification with a 1 year expiry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;azure-role-based-certifications&quot;&gt;Azure Role-Based Certifications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Fundamental&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Associate&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Expert&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;AZ-900&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;AZ-303, AZ-304&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;AZ-900&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;AZ-104&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;AZ-400&lt;/td&gt;

      &lt;td&gt;AZ-400&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;😊 If you want to give exams at &lt;strong&gt;Expert level&lt;/strong&gt; without giving fundamental and associate level exams then &lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt; you can give expert exams directly. As far as you have more than 2 years of experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;job-description-role-for-azure-architects&quot;&gt;Job Description Role for Azure Architects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is an expert level certification.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You don’t have to code&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must understands the code for Azure CLI, Azure PowerSell &amp;amp; KQL queries.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You should be advising stake holders and translating business requirement&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Advanced knowledge &amp;amp; experience of IT Op’s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lot’s of implementations and hands on learning is in AZ-303 exams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;q--a&quot;&gt;Q &amp;amp; A&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;which-one-i-should-take-first&quot;&gt;Which one I should take first?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can take AZ-303 or AZ-304 anyone as your first exam. You will earn a badge for AZ-303 but you will not receive Azure Solution Architect badge unless you do AZ-304 also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-much-time-you-need-to-prepare&quot;&gt;How much time you need to prepare?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I depends on your dedications and efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not yet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;which-book-i-should-read&quot;&gt;Which book I should read?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use Microsoft publications book&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MeasureUp&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whizlabs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;when-my-certificate-expires&quot;&gt;When my certificate expires&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After completing this module, you’ll be able to describe the benefits and usage of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Azure Cosmos DB&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Azure SQL Database&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Azure SQL Managed Instance&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You should be familiar with basic computing concepts and terminology.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You should be familiar with basic database concepts and terminology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;azure-cosmos-db&quot;&gt;Azure Cosmos DB&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want your data to be accessed via many API’s and you have developers with different skill sets. Then I would recommend using Azure Cosmos DB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/UC5N0r6.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed, multi-model database service. You can take advantage of fast, single-digit-millisecond data access by using any one of several popular APIs. Azure Cosmos DB provides comprehensive service level agreements for throughput, latency, availability, and consistency guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure Cosmos DB supports schema-less data, which lets you build highly responsive and “Always On” applications to support constantly changing data. You can use this feature to store data that’s updated and maintained by users around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LzWLt9M.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure Cosmos DB is flexible. At the lowest level, Azure Cosmos DB stores data in atom-record-sequence (ARS) format. The data is then abstracted and projected as an API, which you specify when you’re creating your database. Your choices include SQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Tables, and Gremlin. This level of flexibility means that as you migrate your company’s databases to Azure Cosmos DB, your developers can stick with the API that they’re the most comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;azure-sql-database&quot;&gt;Azure SQL Database&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure SQL Database is a relational database based on the latest stable version of the Microsoft SQL Server database engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7se8XDr.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure SQL Database is a platform as a service (PaaS) database engine. It handles most of the database management functions, such as upgrading, patching, backups, and monitoring, without user involvement. SQL Database provides 99.99 percent availability. SQL Database is a fully managed service that has built-in high availability, backups, and other common maintenance operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use both relational data and non-relational structures, such as graphs, JSON, spatial, and XML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--success&quot;&gt;🏆 &lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The newest capabilities of SQL Server are released first to &lt;strong&gt;SQL Database&lt;/strong&gt;, and then to SQL Server itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;migration&quot;&gt;Migration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can migrate your existing SQL Server databases with minimal downtime by using the Azure Database Migration Service. The Microsoft Data Migration Assistant can generate assessment reports that provide recommendations to help guide you through required changes prior to performing a migration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;exercise---create-a-sql-database&quot;&gt;Exercise - Create a SQL database&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your company suppose you want Azure SQL Database for part of your migration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;task-1-create-the-database&quot;&gt;Task 1: Create the database&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn here &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/azure-database-fundamentals/exercise-create-sql-database&quot;&gt;how to create Azure SQL DB in Azure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/rjno2oM.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;task-2-test-the-database&quot;&gt;Task 2: Test the database&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this task, you configure the server and run a SQL query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/VpgneZv.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;azure-sql-managed-instance&quot;&gt;Azure SQL Managed Instance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure SQL Managed Instance is a scalable cloud data service that provides the broadest &lt;strong&gt;SQL Server database engine&lt;/strong&gt; compatibility with all the benefits of a fully managed platform as a service (PaaS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TUMxq9e.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Azure SQL Managed Instance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Always On&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;99.99-99.995%&lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Attach a database&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;No&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;No&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Auditing&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--warning&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-info-circle&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
See the complete &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/features-comparison&quot;&gt;difference between SQL Database and SQL Managed Instance here.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If several of your databases use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Cyrillic&lt;/code&gt; characters for collation. In this scenario, You should migrate your databases to an Azure SQL Managed Instance, since Azure SQL Database only uses the default &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS&lt;/code&gt; server collation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;migration-1&quot;&gt;Migration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure SQL Managed Instance makes it easy to migrate your on-premises data on SQL Server to the cloud using the Azure Database Migration Service (DMS) or native backup and restore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/VuBdy3W.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--warning&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-info-circle&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For a detailed description of the migration process, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/migration-guides/managed-instance/sql-server-to-managed-instance-guide&quot;&gt;Migration guide: SQL Server to SQL Managed Instance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;azure-database-for-mysql&quot;&gt;Azure database for MySQL&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your company currently manages several websites on-premises that use the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP). Good news is LAMP is possible in Azure. Azure Database for &lt;strong&gt;MySQL is a relational database service&lt;/strong&gt; in the cloud, you have a 99.99 percent availability service level agreement from Azure, powered by a global network of Microsoft-managed datacenters. With Azure Database for MySQL, you can use point-in-time restore to recover a server to an earlier state, as far back as 35 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zqS4DPF.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure Database for MySQL delivers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Built-in high availability with no additional cost.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Predictable performance and inclusive, pay-as-you-go pricing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scale as needed, within seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ability to protect sensitive data at-rest and in-motion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Automatic backups.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enterprise-grade security and compliance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can migrate your existing MySQL databases with minimal downtime by using the Azure Database Migration Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;azure-database-for-postgresql&quot;&gt;Azure Database for PostgreSQL&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure Database for &lt;strong&gt;PostgreSQL is a relational database&lt;/strong&gt; service in the cloud. T&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jgVSNYa.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Azure Database for PostgreSQL delivers the following benefits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Built-in high availability compared to on-premises resources. There’s no additional configuration, replication, or cost required to make sure your applications are always available.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Simple and flexible pricing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scale up or down as needed, within seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adjustable automatic backups and point-in-time-restore for up to 35 days.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enterprise-grade security and compliance to protect sensitive data at-rest and in-motion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure Database for PostgreSQL is available in two deployment options: &lt;strong&gt;Single Server&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Hyperscale (Citus)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;single-server&quot;&gt;Single Server&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Single Server deployment option delivers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Built-in high availability with no additional cost (99.99 percent SLA).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Predictable performance and inclusive, pay-as-you-go pricing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vertical scale as needed, within seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Monitoring and alerting to assess your server.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enterprise-grade security and compliance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ability to protect sensitive data at-rest and in-motion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Automatic backups and point-in-time-restore for up to 35 days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All those capabilities require almost no administration, and all are provided at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Single Server deployment option offers three pricing tiers: Basic, General Purpose, and Memory Optimized.
You only pay for the resources you need, and only when you need them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hyperscale-citus&quot;&gt;Hyperscale (Citus)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hyperscale (Citus) option horizontally scales queries across multiple machines by using sharding. Its query engine parallelizes incoming SQL queries across these servers for faster responses on large datasets. It serves applications that require greater scale and performance, generally workloads that are approaching, or already exceed, 100 GB of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hyperscale (Citus) deployment option supports multi-tenant applications, real-time operational analytics, and high throughput transactional workloads. Applications built for PostgreSQL can run distributed queries on Hyperscale (Citus) with standard connection libraries and minimal changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;big-data-and-analytics&quot;&gt;Big data and analytics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your company sales GPS tracking system for all of your delivery vehicles. And GPS system provides real-time tracking data to your primary datacenter. You want to look at several years of tracking data in order to determine trends. For example, an important trend might be a spike in deliveries around the holidays that would require hiring additional staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data comes in all types of forms and formats. When we talk about big data, we’re referring to large volumes of data. This amount of data becomes increasingly hard to make sense of and to base decisions on. The volumes are so large that traditional forms of processing and analysis are no longer appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open-source cluster technologies have been developed, over time, to try to deal with these large datasets. Microsoft Azure has Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure HDInsight, Azure Databricks, and Azure Data Lake Analytics to provide big data and analytic solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;azure-synapse-analytics&quot;&gt;Azure Synapse Analytics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-data-warehouse/&quot;&gt;Azure Synapse Analytics&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Azure SQL Data Warehouse) is a limitless &lt;strong&gt;analytics service&lt;/strong&gt; that brings together enterprise data warehousing and big data analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1qaunRN.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can query data on your terms by using either serverless or provisioned resources at scale. You have a unified experience to &lt;strong&gt;ingest, prepare, manage, and serve&lt;/strong&gt; data for immediate BI and machine learning needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;azure-hdinsight&quot;&gt;Azure HDInsight&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://azure.microsoft.com/services/hdinsight/&quot;&gt;Azure HDInsight&lt;/a&gt; is a fully managed, open-source analytics service for enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1gRQDNl.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can run popular &lt;strong&gt;open-source frameworks&lt;/strong&gt; and create cluster types such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/spark/apache-spark-overview&quot;&gt;Apache Spark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/hadoop/apache-hadoop-introduction&quot;&gt;Apache Hadoop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/kafka/apache-kafka-introduction&quot;&gt;Apache Kafka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/hbase/apache-hbase-overview&quot;&gt;Apache HBase&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/storm/apache-storm-overview&quot;&gt;Apache Storm&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/r-server/r-server-overview&quot;&gt;Machine Learning Services&lt;/a&gt;. HDInsight also supports extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL), data warehousing, machine learning, and IoT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;azure-databricks&quot;&gt;Azure Databricks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://azure.microsoft.com/services/databricks/&quot;&gt;Azure Databricks&lt;/a&gt; helps you unlock insights from all your data and build artificial intelligence solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HCMZa2F.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can set up your Apache Spark environment in minutes, and then autoscale and collaborate on shared projects in an interactive workspace. Azure Databricks supports Python, Scala, R, Java, and SQL, as well as data science frameworks and libraries including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;azure-data-lake-analytics&quot;&gt;Azure Data Lake Analytics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://azure.microsoft.com/services/data-lake-analytics/&quot;&gt;Azure Data Lake Analytics&lt;/a&gt; is an on-demand analytics job service that simplifies big data. Instead of deploying, configuring, and tuning hardware, you write queries to transform your data and extract valuable insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7Sc8fH7.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analytics service can handle jobs of any scale instantly by setting the dial for how much power you need. You only pay for your job when it’s running, making it more cost-effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;check-your-knowledge&quot;&gt;Check your knowledge&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your development team is interested in writing Graph-based applications that take advantage of the Gremlin API. Which option would be ideal for that scenario? - Azure Cosmos DB&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tailwind Traders uses the LAMP stack for several of its websites. Which option would be ideal for migration? - Azure Database for MySQL&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tailwind Traders has millions of log entries that it wants to analyze. Which option would be ideal for analysis? - Azure Synapse Analytics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Can you explain concepts and terminology for the &lt;strong&gt;core Azure architecture components&lt;/strong&gt;? Can you describe the benefits and usages of Azure &lt;strong&gt;subscriptions&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;management groups&lt;/strong&gt;? Have you check the benefits of Azure &lt;strong&gt;resources&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;resource groups&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Azure Resource Manager&lt;/strong&gt;(ARM)? Did you know how achieve high availability using Azure &lt;strong&gt;regions, region pairs, and availability zones&lt;/strong&gt;? This is the 3rd article on “&lt;strong&gt;Azure Fundamentals part 1: Describe core Azure concepts&lt;/strong&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bJhy0o9.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;azure-resources-structure-organization&quot;&gt;Azure resources structure organization&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/13XFueb.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure organizes structure for resources in four levels: management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, and resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👇 The top-down hierarchy of organization for these levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/jEoLDBr.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;resources&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resources&lt;/strong&gt;: Resources are &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;instances of services&lt;/code&gt; that you create, like virtual machines(VMs), storage accounts, web apps, virtual networks or SQL databases. An Azure resource is a manageable item that’s available through Azure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;resource-groups&quot;&gt;Resource groups&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resource groups&lt;/strong&gt;: Resources are combined into resource groups, which act as a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;logical container&lt;/code&gt; into which Azure resources like web apps, databases, and storage accounts are deployed and managed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;subscriptions&quot;&gt;Subscriptions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subscriptions&lt;/strong&gt;: A subscription &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;groups together user accounts and the resources&lt;/code&gt; that have been created by those user accounts. For each subscription, there are limits or quotas on the amount of resources that you can create and use. Organizations can use subscriptions to manage costs and the resources that are created by users, teams, or projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;management-groups&quot;&gt;Management groups&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Management groups&lt;/strong&gt;: These groups help you &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;manage access, policy, and compliance&lt;/code&gt; for multiple subscriptions. All subscriptions in a management group automatically inherit the conditions applied to the management group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;azure-subscriptions-and-management-groups&quot;&gt;Azure subscriptions and management groups&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to start with Azure you must create at-least one subscription with Azure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;azure-subscriptions&quot;&gt;Azure subscriptions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Azure requires an Azure subscription. A subscription provides you with &lt;strong&gt;authenticated and authorized&lt;/strong&gt; access to Azure products and services. It also allows you to &lt;strong&gt;provision&lt;/strong&gt; resources. An Azure subscription is a &lt;strong&gt;logical unit&lt;/strong&gt; of Azure services that links to an Azure account, which is an identity in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) or in a directory that Azure AD trusts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/EfIRY0g.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two types of subscription boundaries that you can use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Billing boundary&lt;/strong&gt;: You can create multiple subscriptions for different types of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;billing requirements&lt;/code&gt;. Azure generates separate billing reports and invoices for each subscription so that you can organize and manage costs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access control boundary&lt;/strong&gt;: Azure applies &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;access-management policies&lt;/code&gt; at the subscription level, and you can create separate subscriptions to reflect different organizational structures. An example within a business, you have different departments to which you apply distinct Azure subscription &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;policies&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;create-additional-azure-subscriptions&quot;&gt;Create additional Azure subscriptions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might want to create additional subscriptions for &lt;strong&gt;resource&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;billing&lt;/strong&gt; management purposes. For example, you might choose to create additional subscriptions to separate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environments:&lt;/strong&gt; Set up separate environments for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;development&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;testing&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;security&lt;/code&gt;, or to isolate data for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;compliance&lt;/code&gt; reasons. This design is particularly useful because resource &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;access control&lt;/code&gt; occurs at the subscription level.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organizational structures:&lt;/strong&gt; You could limit a team to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;lower-cost&lt;/code&gt; resources, while allowing the IT department a full range. This design allows you to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;manage and control access&lt;/code&gt; to the resources that users provision within each subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Billing:&lt;/strong&gt; Because costs are first aggregated at the subscription level, you might want to create subscriptions to manage and track costs based on your needs. For instance, you might want to create one subscription for your &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;production&lt;/code&gt; workloads and another subscription for your &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;development&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;testing&lt;/code&gt; workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subscription limits:&lt;/strong&gt; Subscriptions are bound to some hard limitations. For example, the maximum number of Azure &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ExpressRoute&lt;/code&gt; circuits per subscription is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;. If there’s a need to go over those limits in particular scenarios, you might need additional subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;customize-billing-to-meet-your-needs&quot;&gt;Customize billing to meet your needs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have multiple subscriptions, you can organize them into &lt;strong&gt;invoice sections&lt;/strong&gt;. Each invoice section is a line item on the invoice that shows the charges incurred that month. For example, you might need a single invoice for your organization but want to organize charges by department, team, or project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on your needs, you can set up multiple invoices within the same billing account. To do this, create additional &lt;strong&gt;billing profiles&lt;/strong&gt;. Each billing profile has its own monthly invoice and payment method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following diagram shows an overview of how billing is structured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/TceedRv.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;azure-management-groups&quot;&gt;Azure management groups&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You organize subscriptions into containers called management groups and apply your &lt;strong&gt;governance conditions&lt;/strong&gt; to the management groups. All subscriptions within a management group automatically inherit the conditions applied to the management group and must trust the same Azure AD tenant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, you can apply policies to a management group that limits the regions available for VM creation. This policy would be applied to all management groups, subscriptions, and resources under that management group by only allowing VMs to be created in that region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hierarchy-of-management-groups-and-subscriptions&quot;&gt;Hierarchy of management groups and subscriptions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create structure of management groups and subscriptions to organize your resources into a hierarchy for unified policy and access management. The following diagram shows an example of creating a hierarchy for governance by using management groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--success&quot;&gt;🏆 &lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
☑️ You can create a hierarchy that &lt;strong&gt;applies a policy&lt;/strong&gt;.
☑️ You can use management groups is to provide user &lt;strong&gt;access to multiple subscriptions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/8rz4kAp.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can create a hierarchy that applies a policy. For example, you could limit VM locations to the US West Region in a group called Production. This policy will inherit onto all the Enterprise Agreement subscriptions that are descendants of that management group and will apply to all VMs under those subscriptions. This security policy can’t be altered by the resource or subscription owner, which allows for improved governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another scenario where you would use management groups is to provide user access to multiple subscriptions. By moving multiple subscriptions under that management group, you can create one role-based access control (RBAC) assignment on the management group, which will inherit that access to all the subscriptions. One assignment on the management group can enable users to have access to everything they need instead of scripting RBAC over different subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;important-facts-about-management-groups&quot;&gt;Important facts about management groups&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10,000&lt;/strong&gt; management groups can be supported in a single directory.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A management group tree can support up to &lt;strong&gt;six levels of depth&lt;/strong&gt;. This limit doesn’t include the root level or the subscription level.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each management group and subscription can support only one parent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each management group can have many children.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All subscriptions and management groups are within a single hierarchy in each directory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;azure-resources-and-azure-resource-manager&quot;&gt;Azure resources and Azure Resource Manager&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you’ve created a subscription for your company, you’re ready to start creating resources and storing them in resource groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resource&lt;/strong&gt;: A manageable item that’s available through Azure. Virtual machines (VMs), storage accounts, web apps, databases, and virtual networks are examples of resources.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resource group&lt;/strong&gt;: A container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. The resource group includes resources that you want to manage as a group. You decide which resources belong in a resource group based on what makes the most sense for your organization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;azure-resource-groups&quot;&gt;Azure resource groups&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resource groups are a fundamental element of the Azure platform. A resource group is a logical container for resources deployed on Azure. These resources are anything you create in an Azure subscription like VMs, Azure Application Gateway instances, and Azure Cosmos DB instances. All resources must be in a resource group, and a resource can only be a member of a single resource group. Many resources can be moved between resource groups with some services having specific limitations or requirements to move. Resource groups can’t be nested. Before any resource can be provisioned, you need a resource group for it to be placed in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AEfN0eC.png&quot; alt=&quot;resource group is a container for resources&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;logical-grouping&quot;&gt;Logical grouping&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resource groups exist to help manage and organize your Azure resources. By placing resources of similar usage, type, or location in a resource group, you can provide order and organization to resources you create in Azure. Logical grouping is the aspect that you’re most interested in here, because there’s a lot of disorder among our resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZRXeJOu.png&quot; alt=&quot;Conceptual image showing a resource group box with a function, VM, database, and app included.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;life-cycle&quot;&gt;Life cycle&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you delete a resource group, all resources contained within it are also deleted. Organizing resources by life cycle can be useful in nonproduction environments, where you might try an experiment and then dispose of it. Resource groups make it easy to remove a set of resources all at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;authorization&quot;&gt;Authorization&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resource groups are also a scope for applying role-based access control (RBAC) permissions. By applying RBAC permissions to a resource group, you can ease administration and limit access to allow only what’s needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/T0UyegM.png&quot; alt=&quot;using RBAC to give required access to specific users&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;azure-resource-manager&quot;&gt;Azure Resource Manager&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure Resource Manager is the deployment and management service for Azure. It provides a management layer that enables you to create, update, and delete resources in your Azure account. You use management features like access control, locks, and tags to secure and organize your resources after deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a user sends a request from any of the Azure tools, APIs, or SDKs, Resource Manager receives the request. It authenticates and authorizes the request. Resource Manager sends the request to the Azure service, which takes the requested action. Because all requests are handled through the same API, you see consistent results and capabilities in all the different tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following image shows the role Resource Manager plays in handling Azure requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2Wjh42D.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram showing a Resource Manager request model.&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--success&quot;&gt;🏆 &lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All capabilities that are available in the Azure portal are also available through &lt;strong&gt;PowerShell, the Azure CLI, REST APIs, and client SDKs&lt;/strong&gt;. Functionality initially released through APIs will be represented in the portal &lt;strong&gt;within 180 days&lt;/strong&gt; of initial release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-benefits-of-using-resource-manager&quot;&gt;The benefits of using Resource Manager&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Resource Manager, you can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Manage your infrastructure through declarative templates rather than scripts. A Resource Manager template is a JSON file that defines what you want to deploy to Azure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deploy, manage, and monitor all the resources for your solution as a group, rather than handling these resources individually.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Redeploy your solution throughout the development life cycle and have confidence your resources are deployed in a consistent state.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Define the dependencies between resources so they’re deployed in the correct order.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apply access control to all services because RBAC is natively integrated into the management platform.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apply tags to resources to logically organize all the resources in your subscription.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clarify your organization’s billing by viewing costs for a group of resources that share the same tag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;azure-regions-availability-zones-and-region-pairs&quot;&gt;Azure regions, availability zones, and region pairs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resources are created in regions, which are different geographical locations around the globe that contain Azure datacenters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure is made up of datacenters located around the globe. When you use a service or create a resource such as a SQL database or virtual machine (VM), you’re using physical equipment in one or more of these locations. Some of these regions offer &lt;strong&gt;availability zones&lt;/strong&gt;, which are &lt;em&gt;different Azure datacenters within that region&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5yn9L3w.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;azure-regions&quot;&gt;Azure Regions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A region is a geographical area on the planet that contains at least one but potentially multiple datacenters that are nearby and networked together with a low-latency network. A few examples of regions are West US, Canada Central, West Europe, Australia East, and Japan West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--info&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-info-circle&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Important&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some services or VM features are only available in certain regions, such as specific VM sizes or storage types. There are also some global Azure services that don’t require you to select a particular region, such as Azure Active Directory, Azure Traffic Manager, and Azure DNS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a view of all the available regions as of June 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/OSccfDf.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-are-regions-important&quot;&gt;Why are regions important?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure has more global regions than any other cloud provider. These regions give you the flexibility to bring applications closer to your users no matter where they are. Global regions provide better scalability and redundancy. They also preserve data residency for your services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--success&quot;&gt;🏆 &lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Regions are what you use to identify the location for your resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;special-azure-regions&quot;&gt;Special Azure regions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure has specialized regions that you might want to use when you build out your applications for compliance or legal purposes. A few examples include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US DoD Central, US Gov Virginia, US Gov Iowa and more:&lt;/strong&gt; These regions are physical and logical network-isolated instances of Azure for U.S. government agencies and partners. These datacenters are operated by screened U.S. personnel and include additional compliance certifications.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China East, China North, and more:&lt;/strong&gt; These regions are available through a unique partnership between Microsoft and 21Vianet, whereby Microsoft doesn’t directly maintain the datacenters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;azure-availability-zones&quot;&gt;Azure availability zones&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want to ensure your services and data are redundant so you can protect your information in case of failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-is-an-availability-zone&quot;&gt;What is an availability zone?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Availability zones are physically separate datacenters within an Azure region. Each availability zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. An availability zone is set up to be an &lt;em&gt;isolation boundary&lt;/em&gt;. If one zone goes down, the other continues working. Availability zones are connected through high-speed, private fiber-optic networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RGunblm.png&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram showing three datacenters connected within a single Azure region to represent an availability zone.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--info&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-info-circle&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Important&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not every region has support for availability zones. For an updated list, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/availability-zones/az-region&quot;&gt;Regions that support availability zones in Azure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;use-availability-zones-in-your-apps&quot;&gt;Use availability zones in your apps&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use availability zones to run mission-critical applications and build high-availability into your application architecture by co-locating your compute, storage, networking, and data resources within a zone and replicating in other zones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Availability zones are primarily for VMs, managed disks, load balancers, and SQL databases. Azure services that support availability zones fall into two categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zonal services&lt;/strong&gt;: You pin the resource to a specific zone (for example, VMs, managed disks, IP addresses).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zone-redundant services&lt;/strong&gt;: The platform replicates automatically across zones (for example, zone-redundant storage, SQL Database)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--success&quot;&gt;🏆 &lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Availability zones are created by using one or more datacenters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;azure-region-pairs&quot;&gt;Azure region pairs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a minimum of three zones within a single region. It’s possible that a large disaster could cause an outage big enough to affect even two datacenters. That’s why Azure also creates &lt;em&gt;region pairs&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-a-region-pair&quot;&gt;What is a region pair?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each Azure region is always paired with another region within the same geography (such as US, Europe, or Asia) at least 300 miles away. This approach allows for the replication of resources (such as VM storage) across a geography that helps reduce the likelihood of interruptions because of events such as natural disasters, civil unrest, power outages, or physical network outages that affect both regions at once. If a region in a pair was affected by a natural disaster, for instance, services would automatically failover to the other region in its region pair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of region pairs in Azure are West US paired with East US and SouthEast Asia paired with East Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/lkZAC1H.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram showing the relationship between geography, region pair, region, and datacenter. The geography box contains two region pairs. Each region pair contains two Azure regions. Each region contains three availability zones.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the pair of regions is directly connected and far enough apart to be isolated from regional disasters, you can use them to provide reliable services and data redundancy. Some services offer automatic geo-redundant storage by using region pairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If an extensive Azure outage occurs, one region out of every pair is prioritized to make sure at least one is restored as quickly as possible for applications hosted in that region pair.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Planned Azure updates are rolled out to paired regions one region at a time to minimize downtime and risk of application outage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data continues to reside within the same geography as its pair (except for Brazil South) for tax- and law-enforcement jurisdiction purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--success&quot;&gt;🏆 &lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Having a broadly distributed set of datacenters allows Azure to provide a high guarantee of availability.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Do you want to understand binary search? Read this article, I have discussed binary search problems in JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;binary-search-concept&quot;&gt;Binary Search Concept&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU7DpgHINWQ&amp;amp;list=PLl0KD3g-oDOHpWRyyGBUJ9jmul0lUOD80&amp;amp;index=3&quot;&gt;this YouTube video from Errichto&lt;/a&gt;. This is the best binary search video I have ever seen. Next solve all the problems as he is going in his lecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Binary search can be done on a given sorted array and it is is used to perform:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Search a number&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Search a number with given conditions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find real values like square, square root etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thumb-of-rule-for-binary-search-problems&quot;&gt;Thumb of rule for Binary Search problems&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Divide your array in set of TRUE and FALSE values then find the First occurrence of TRUE or the last occurrence of TRUE. Binary Search Array should be partially false and partially true. We need to find the boundary between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Do you love open-source? Do you want to make your PowerShell really powerful? Consider installing &lt;strong&gt;scoop&lt;/strong&gt; and make your life simple! 😄 Learn how can scoop help you to make your &lt;strong&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/strong&gt; terminal colorful. This was my dream on windows machine to achieve. Please read my article till end and enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-scoop&quot;&gt;What is Scoop&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scoop.sh/&quot;&gt;Scoop&lt;/a&gt; is used to install tools or utilities or plugins for windows PowerShell or CommandLine. You can use scoop to install curl on windows machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/w1X3139.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will install scoop to colorful my PowerShell like this.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/rUjIDfd.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
And then I will also make sure my Visual Studio Code terminal looks colorful like this.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-installing-scoop&quot;&gt;🦂 Installing Scoop&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open PowerShell 7 in admin mode.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;iex&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then in command enter &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString(&apos;https://get.scoop.sh&apos;)&lt;/code&gt; and hit enter. &lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/QJ2gNWY.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Or You can directly Run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(&apos;https://get.scoop.sh&apos;)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/s3NCn8m.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;confirm-scoop-installed&quot;&gt;Confirm Scoop Installed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scoop help&lt;/code&gt; and see if it is installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/5JXukJD.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;installing-curl-using-scoop-on-windows&quot;&gt;Installing Curl using Scoop on Windows&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/w1X3139.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;coloring-your-powershell&quot;&gt;🥇Coloring your PowerShell&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open PowerShell profile normally it is at &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;c:\users\&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;\My Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1&lt;/code&gt;. Run $profile to learn where is your profile. If not then create new one.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add below script in profile file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Invoke-Expression &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;oh-my-posh &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--init&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--shell&lt;/span&gt; pwsh &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--config&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;scoop prefix oh-my-posh&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;/themes/nu4a.omp.json&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;installing-on-my-posh&quot;&gt;Installing on-my-posh&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scoop install https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/releases/latest/download/oh-my-posh.json&lt;/code&gt; to install &lt;strong&gt;on-my-post&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/2X3fbbH.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This installs a couple of things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;oh-my-posh.exe&lt;/code&gt; - Windows executable, added to your $PATH&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;oh-my-posh-wsl&lt;/code&gt; - Linux executable, added to your $PATH for use in the WSL&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;themes&lt;/code&gt; - The latest Oh my Posh themes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;install-nerd-fonts&quot;&gt;Install Nerd Fonts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oh-My-Posh&lt;/strong&gt; needs Nerd Font therefore, you must install them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads&quot;&gt;Download Nerd Fonts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After downloading font install it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open PowerShell and select your Nerd Font. I am using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MesloLGL NF&lt;/code&gt; Font.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/BFgpANA.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;powershell-is-colorful&quot;&gt;PowerShell is Colorful&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open PowerShell and notice it shows colors and Git status.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/zIN7HRH.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;-changing-theme&quot;&gt;🛕 Changing Theme&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to the folder where oh-my-posh is installed. Next go to the themes folder you will notice there are 37 themes.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/4MNcEBm.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;visualizing-all-themes&quot;&gt;Visualizing All Themes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;get-poshthemes&lt;/code&gt; on PowerShell terminal to see all of them.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/XVf7nQM.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;changing-theme-of-powershell&quot;&gt;Changing Theme of PowerShell&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you select your new theme then open PowerShell profile and change the theme &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;json&lt;/code&gt; name. I have currently &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;themes\nu4a.omp.json&lt;/code&gt; I will switch to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;themes\cert&lt;/code&gt;. With below new script&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-powershell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Invoke-Expression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;oh-my-posh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--shell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pwsh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;scoop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;prefix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;oh-my-posh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;/themes/cert.omp.json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;)👈

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at my new theme now &lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/p6wHB52.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All done 🎉 enjoy power of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scoop&lt;/code&gt; and coolness of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PowerShell&lt;/code&gt; on your windows machine.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Open PowerShell profile normally it is at &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;c:\users\&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;\My Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1&lt;/code&gt;. Run $profile to learn where is your profile. If not then create new one.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add below script in profile file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Invoke-Expression &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;oh-my-posh &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--init&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--shell&lt;/span&gt; pwsh &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--config&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;scoop prefix oh-my-posh&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;/themes/nu4a.omp.json&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;installing-on-my-posh&quot;&gt;Installing on-my-posh&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scoop install https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/releases/latest/download/oh-my-posh.json&lt;/code&gt; to install &lt;strong&gt;on-my-post&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/2X3fbbH.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This installs a couple of things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;oh-my-posh.exe&lt;/code&gt; - Windows executable, added to your $PATH&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;oh-my-posh-wsl&lt;/code&gt; - Linux executable, added to your $PATH for use in the WSL&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;themes&lt;/code&gt; - The latest Oh my Posh themes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;install-nerd-fonts&quot;&gt;Install Nerd Fonts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oh-My-Posh&lt;/strong&gt; needs Nerd Font therefore, you must install them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads&quot;&gt;Download Nerd Fonts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After downloading font install it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open PowerShell and select your Nerd Font. I am using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MesloLGL NF&lt;/code&gt; Font.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/BFgpANA.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;powershell-is-colorful&quot;&gt;PowerShell is Colorful&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open PowerShell and notice it shows colors and Git status.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/zIN7HRH.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;-changing-theme&quot;&gt;🛕 Changing Theme&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to the folder where oh-my-posh is installed. Next go to the themes folder you will notice there are 37 themes.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/4MNcEBm.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;visualizing-all-themes&quot;&gt;Visualizing All Themes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;get-poshthemes&lt;/code&gt; on PowerShell terminal to see all of them.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/XVf7nQM.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;changing-theme-of-powershell&quot;&gt;Changing Theme of PowerShell&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you select your new theme then open PowerShell profile and change the theme &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;json&lt;/code&gt; name. I have currently &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;themes\nu4a.omp.json&lt;/code&gt; I will switch to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;themes\cert&lt;/code&gt;. With below new script&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-powershell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Invoke-Expression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;oh-my-posh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--shell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pwsh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;scoop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;prefix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;oh-my-posh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;/themes/cert.omp.json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;)👈

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at my new theme now &lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/p6wHB52.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Did you know the &lt;strong&gt;benefits&lt;/strong&gt;(availability, scalability, and geographic distribution) of cloud computing? Did you know what are the &lt;strong&gt;categories&lt;/strong&gt;(IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) of cloud computing? And, can you differences between &lt;strong&gt;types&lt;/strong&gt;(public, private, and hybrid) of cloud computing? In this article we will summaries all of these!

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-are-some-cloud-computing-advantages&quot;&gt;What are some cloud computing advantages?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--success&quot;&gt;🏆 &lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember the sentence &lt;a href=&quot;https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/gashed&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GASHED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt; = &lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt;eo-distribution
&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; = &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;gility
&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt; = &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;calability
&lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt; = &lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt;igh availability
&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt; = &lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;lasticity
&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; = &lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;isaster recovery&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👇 Below are also called as cloud concepts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geo-distribution&lt;/strong&gt;: You can deploy apps and data to regional datacenters around the globe, thereby ensuring that your customers always have the best performance in their region.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agility&lt;/strong&gt;: Deploy and configure cloud-based resources quickly as your app requirements change.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scalability&lt;/strong&gt;: Apps in the cloud can scale &lt;em&gt;vertically&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;horizontally&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Scale vertically to increase compute capacity by adding RAM or CPUs to a virtual machine.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Scaling horizontally increases compute capacity by adding instances of resources, such as adding VMs to the configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High availability&lt;/strong&gt;: Depending on the service-level agreement (SLA) that you choose, your cloud-based apps can provide a continuous user experience with no apparent downtime, even when things go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elasticity&lt;/strong&gt;: You can configure cloud-based apps to take advantage of autoscaling, so your apps always have the resources they need. It can decrease resource if they are underused or increase if demand is high.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaster recovery&lt;/strong&gt;: By taking advantage of cloud-based backup services, data replication, and geo-distribution, you can deploy your apps with the confidence that comes from knowing that your data is safe in the event of disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cloud-computing-is-a-consumption-based-model&quot;&gt;Cloud computing is a consumption-based model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;End users only pay for the resources that they use. Whatever they use is what they pay for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A consumption-based model has many benefits, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No upfront costs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use to its fullest.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The ability to pay for additional resources when they are needed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;capital-expenses-vs-operating-expenses&quot;&gt;Capital expenses vs. operating expenses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two different types of expenses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capital Expenditure (CapEx)&lt;/strong&gt; requires significant up-front financial costs, as well as ongoing maintenance and support expenditures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational Expenditure (OpEx)&lt;/strong&gt;: OpEx is a consumption-based model, so Your company is only responsible for the cost of the computing resources that it uses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;describe-the-different-categories-of-cloud-services&quot;&gt;Describe the different categories of cloud services&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-are-cloud-service-models&quot;&gt;What are cloud service models?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 3 Cloud Service Models:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)&lt;/strong&gt; the cloud provider will keep the hardware up-to-date, but operating system maintenance and network configuration is up to you as the cloud tenant.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)&lt;/strong&gt; the cloud provider manages the virtual machines and networking resources, and the cloud tenant deploys their applications into the managed hosting environment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software-as-a-Service(SaaS)&lt;/strong&gt; the cloud provider manages all aspects of the application environment, such as virtual machines, networking resources, data storage, and applications. The cloud tenant only needs to provide their data to the application managed by the cloud provider.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following illustration demonstrates the services that might run in each of the cloud service models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/Ia6D7IM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following chart illustrates the various levels of responsibility between a cloud provider and a cloud tenant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/tCJ0p7V.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-serverless-computing&quot;&gt;What is serverless computing?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a PaaS model. Normally used by developers to build applications faster. With serverless applications, the cloud service provider automatically provisions, scales, and manages the infrastructure required to run the code. Serverless architectures are highly scalable and event-driven, only using resources when a specific function or trigger occurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--success&quot;&gt;🏆 &lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The “serverless” name comes from the fact that the tasks associated with infrastructure provisioning and management are invisible to the developer. This approach enables developers to increase their focus on the business logic, and deliver more value to the core of the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;describe-the-different-types-of-cloud-computing&quot;&gt;Describe the different types of cloud computing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-are-public-private-and-hybrid-clouds&quot;&gt;What are public, private, and hybrid clouds?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three deployment models:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public cloud&lt;/strong&gt; is cloud resources, such as servers and storage, are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider, and delivered over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private cloud&lt;/strong&gt; consists of computing resources used exclusively by users from one business or organization. A private cloud can be physically located at your organization’s on-site (on-premises) datacenter, or it can be hosted by a third-party service provider.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hybrid cloud&lt;/strong&gt; is a computing environment that combines a public cloud and a private cloud by allowing data and applications to be shared between them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Do you want to &lt;strong&gt;build&lt;/strong&gt; your first &lt;strong&gt;Angular App&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;deploy&lt;/strong&gt; over cloud using &lt;strong&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/strong&gt;? How to deploy/publish Angular App to GitHub Pages automatically? Did you use &lt;strong&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;build&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;deploy&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Angular&lt;/strong&gt; App over &lt;strong&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/strong&gt;? Stay tuned in this article I will show you step by step from creating angular app to building and deploying using &lt;strong&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/YpOnPp5.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-we-building&quot;&gt;What are we building&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will build an angular application &amp;amp; deploy over &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-an-angular-application&quot;&gt;Creating an Angular Application&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run Below script to create new angular app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng new sample-app&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/h9kicuF.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;install-npm-package&quot;&gt;Install Npm package&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng add angular-cli-ghpages&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-the-steps-on-build&quot;&gt;What are the steps on Build&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;✔️ Build&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;✔️ Lint&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;✔️ Test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-github-actions&quot;&gt;Creating GitHub Actions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s create GitHub workflow with jobs. Note that now a days GitHub actions runner sets the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CI=true&lt;/code&gt; by default. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.blog/changelog/2020-04-15-github-actions-sets-the-ci-environment-variable-to-true/&quot;&gt;Learn more here&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;name-of-workflow&quot;&gt;Name of Workflow&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Angular GitHub CI&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# 👈&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trigger-on-main-branch&quot;&gt;Trigger on Main Branch&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s trigger the job whenever &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; branch got new push.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;branches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# 👈&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;node-versions&quot;&gt;Node Versions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s run on multiple node versions on &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ubuntu-latest&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;jobs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ci&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;runs-on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;ubuntu-latest&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;strategy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;matrix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;node-version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;10.x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;12.x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# 👆&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note we are using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;node10&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;node12&lt;/code&gt;/ Therefore, at a time there will be parallelly 2 jobs will run one for 10.x and one for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;12.x&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/gHBzHqt.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;checkout-source-code&quot;&gt;Checkout source code&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s checkout the code first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;actions/checkout@v2&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;# 👆&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;setup-node-environment&quot;&gt;Setup Node Environment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Use Node.js $&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;actions/setup-node@v1&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;node-version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;# 👆&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-github-cache&quot;&gt;Use GitHub Cache&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s use GitHub Cache to save &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt;. Learn more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rupeshtiwari.com/caching-dependencies-on-github-workflows&quot;&gt;Caching GitHub Workflow dependencies here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/81a8c36affe7ed445b78941a1070996d.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;install-dependencies&quot;&gt;Install Dependencies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we must install node packages conditionally. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rupeshtiwari.com/caching-dependencies-on-github-workflows&quot;&gt;Learn more here&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Install Dependencies&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;steps.cache-nodemodules.outputs.cache-hit != &apos;true&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;# 👆 if cache hits the skip this step.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;npm ci&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;building-project&quot;&gt;Building Project&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s run build in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;production mode&lt;/code&gt; to compile our project. We need to pass &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-- --prod&lt;/code&gt; so that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng build --prod&lt;/code&gt; will be executed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Build&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;npm run build -- --prod&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;linting-project&quot;&gt;Linting Project&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s run linting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Lint&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;npm run lint&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;testing-project&quot;&gt;Testing Project&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s run test in production mode. We need to make sure while running Test:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;✔️ we are using &lt;strong&gt;chrome headless browser&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;browsers&quot;: &quot;ChromeHeadless&quot;&lt;/code&gt; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;✔️ Generating code coverage &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;codeCoverage&quot;: true,&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;✔️ Ignoring Source Map &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;sourceMap&quot;: false&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;👁️ Make sure not in watch mode ` “watch”: false`&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the above settings can be done in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;angular.json&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navigate to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;angular.json&lt;/code&gt; file identify project name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to test object. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;projects.sample-app.architect.test&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add below code configuration for production.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-json highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;configurations&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;production&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;sourceMap&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;codeCoverage&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;browsers&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;ChromeHeadless&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;watch&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-json highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;test&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;builder&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;@angular-devkit/build-angular:karma&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;configurations&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;👈&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;production&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
              &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;sourceMap&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
              &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;codeCoverage&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
              &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;browsers&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;ChromeHeadless&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
              &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;watch&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;👈&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;options&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;main&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;src/test.ts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;polyfills&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;src/polyfills.ts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;tsConfig&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;tsconfig.spec.json&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;karmaConfig&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;karma.conf.js&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;assets&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
              &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;src/favicon.ico&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
              &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;src/assets&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;styles&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
              &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;src/styles.scss&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;scripts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets add below script in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;main.yml&lt;/code&gt; file. Which will use above production test configuration while running in build machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Test&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;npm run test -- --prod&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;triggering-github-workflow&quot;&gt;Triggering GitHub Workflow&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now is the time to see our workflow in action. Go ahead and push the changes to GitHub and check your actions tab on github.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/O8K0LCG.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice both jobs are completed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/zp6CsLX.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;complete-yaml-file&quot;&gt;Complete YAML file&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/c062101984b3dea4e953f5698ed09be2.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;deploying-angular-app-to-github-pages&quot;&gt;Deploying Angular App to GitHub Pages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next once you know your project is passing all these below steps under &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CI&lt;/code&gt; job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;✔️ Build&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;✔️ Lint&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;✔️ Test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we must deploy the app to somewhere. In this example I will deploy our app to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;github-pages&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/strong&gt; are free where you can host your static site. I am going explain you the steps to deploy your angular app there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-ng-deploy&quot;&gt;Using Ng Deploy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng deploy&lt;/code&gt; is the &lt;strong&gt;Angular CLI command&lt;/strong&gt; that automates the deployment of Angular App to &lt;strong&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/strong&gt;. When you run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng deploy&lt;/code&gt;, it executes a builder that performs the deployment for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-cli-ghpages&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;angular-cli-ghpages&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; builder by Running script &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng add angular-cli-ghpages&lt;/code&gt; on command line from root of your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deploying-to-github-pages-from-local-machine&quot;&gt;Deploying to GitHub Pages From Local machine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In GitHub Page server we must give &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;base-href&lt;/code&gt; to our &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;repository name&lt;/code&gt; so that It can host our static files successfully. Since our GitHub repository name is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;angular-ci-cd-with-github-actions&lt;/code&gt; my deploy script would be: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng deploy --base-href=/angular-ci-cd-with-github-actions/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add below script on &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;deploy&quot;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;ng deploy --base-href=/angular-ci-cd-with-github-actions/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can even run the deploy command from local machine to test &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm run deploy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/wHjIBg7.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;your-app-is-live-on-githubpage&quot;&gt;Your App is Live on GitHubPage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to the settings of your GitHub Repository and notice the Site is published. Wait for 2-5 mins and then browse your app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/QMizEsH.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice our site is up and running on GitHub Pages&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/lZ1Qij8.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;update-github-actions-to-deploy-angular-app&quot;&gt;Update GitHub Actions to Deploy Angular App&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next let’s update the workflow to deploy our app over GitHub Pages. Below 2 steps we will run whenever previous steps are passing. Note that that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;if: success()&lt;/code&gt; is always implied unless you specify &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;if: always()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;if: failure()&lt;/code&gt; . Therefore, I am not adding if condition in my steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;creating-change-log&quot;&gt;Creating Change Log&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add secret called as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;TOKEN_GITHUB_ACTION&lt;/code&gt; to your repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/tQNt59s.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we will use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/TriPSs/conventional-changelog-action&quot;&gt;Conventional ChangeLog Action&lt;/a&gt; to create our change log.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/ae8a69e9004fd19773e1cdfbf9dad768.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Conventional Changelog Action&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;changelog&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;TriPSs/conventional-changelog-action@v3&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;github-token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;output-file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;false&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;creating-github-release&quot;&gt;Creating GitHub Release&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we will use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/TriPSs/conventional-changelog-action&quot;&gt;Conventional ChangeLog Action&lt;/a&gt; to tag our repo and create GitHub Release. Note: If you have no changes then this will &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; create a &lt;strong&gt;release&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/432995b8ead5171de82e2623f446b60f.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deploy-to-github-pages&quot;&gt;Deploy to GitHub Pages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally let’s deploy the app to GitHub Pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Deploy&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;npm run deploy&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;complete-yaml-for-deploying-angular-app-to-github-pages&quot;&gt;Complete YAML for deploying angular app to GitHub-Pages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/rupeshtiwari/9f252dc665656c434c4d50a70519f9ac&quot;&gt;final workflow&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/9f252dc665656c434c4d50a70519f9ac.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/YpOnPp5.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if you push the changes workflow will trigger and CI/CD will succeed 🆒!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/aflIgUO.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;While building/compiling &lt;strong&gt;angular&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;node&lt;/strong&gt; application on &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Local Build Machine&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Azure Pipelines&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GitHub Workflows&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Netflix&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Heroku&lt;/code&gt;. The main issue we face is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm ci&lt;/code&gt; which takes large amount of time to finish. Which slows-down the productivity of the team. With &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GitHub Workflows&lt;/code&gt; &lt;strong&gt;dependency caching&lt;/strong&gt; you can reduce the &lt;strong&gt;install time to half&lt;/strong&gt;. Therefore, in this article we will learn how can you leverage the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GitHub caching&lt;/code&gt; workflow dependencies mechanism to improve speed and save network utilization or bandwidth of your build server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/zUODzD0.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;github-actions-cache-workflow-dependencies&quot;&gt;GitHub Actions: Cache workflow Dependencies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will learn:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;✔️ Cache &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; from workflow.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;✔️ &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;skip npm install&lt;/code&gt; when a cached version is available.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;✔️ &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;invalidate the cache&lt;/code&gt; when our &lt;strong&gt;dependencies are changed&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;github-actions-basics&quot;&gt;GitHub Actions Basics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;workflow&quot;&gt;Workflow&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A workflow is a unit of automation from start to finish, including the definition of what triggers the automation, what environment or other aspects should be taken account during the automation, and what should happen as a result of the trigger.(GitHub, 2020).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;job&quot;&gt;Job&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A job is a section of the workflow, and is made up of one or more steps. In this section of our workflow, the template defines the steps that make up the build job.(GitHub, 2020).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step&quot;&gt;Step&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A step represents one effect of the automation. A step could be defined as a GitHub Action, or another unit, like printing something to the console.(GitHub, 2020).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;action&quot;&gt;Action&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A GitHub Action is a piece of automation written in a way that is compatible with workflows. Actions can be written by GitHub, by the open source community, or you can write them yourself!(GitHub, 2020).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-cache-action&quot;&gt;Using Cache Action&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;action-name&quot;&gt;Action Name&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;actions/cache@v2&lt;/code&gt; to save and restore npm dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-do-we-cache&quot;&gt;What do we cache?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally we cache &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; folder in node or angular applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;when-new-cache-creates&quot;&gt;When New Cache Creates?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;package-lock.json&lt;/code&gt; file changes cache action will create new cache with cache key. The Cache key uses context and expression to generate a new cache key that includes the runner’s operating system and a SHA-256 hash of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;package-lock.json&lt;/code&gt; file. When key doesn’t match an existing cache, it’s called a &lt;strong&gt;cache miss&lt;/strong&gt;, and a new cache is created &lt;strong&gt;if the job completes successfully&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;when-cache-is-restored&quot;&gt;When Cache is Restored?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you push a code and your &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;package-lock.json&lt;/code&gt; file is not changed. Then cache action will compare the cache key and if it matches an existing cache, it is called as &lt;strong&gt;cache hit&lt;/strong&gt;. And the cache action will restore the cached &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; files to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;path&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-restore-keys&quot;&gt;What is &lt;strong&gt;restore-keys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a cache miss occurs, the action searches for alternate keys called &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;restore-keys&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-workflow-with-cache-action&quot;&gt;Creating Workflow with Cache Action&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s create new GitHub Workflow and add add &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;actions/cache@v2&lt;/code&gt; action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;caching-node_modules-in-workflow&quot;&gt;Caching node_modules in Workflow&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is one example how can you add &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;actions/cache@v2&lt;/code&gt; action in your GitHub workflow. We want to cache &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; folder. Therefore, lets set &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;path: node_modules&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;package-lock.json&lt;/code&gt; file changes we want to recreate cache. Therefore, let’s use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;package-lock.json&lt;/code&gt; in our key. Also key will have &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;os&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cach-name&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the &lt;strong&gt;cache hit&lt;/strong&gt; happens then the below step will output &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cache-hit as true&lt;/code&gt;. Therefore, this express &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;steps.cache-nodemodules.outputs.cache-hit&lt;/code&gt; will be &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/81a8c36affe7ed445b78941a1070996d.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;skip-npm-install&quot;&gt;Skip Npm Install&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now lets check if &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;steps.cache-nodemodules.outputs.cache-hit&lt;/code&gt; will be &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; then we must not run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Install Dependencies&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;steps.cache-nodemodules.outputs.cache-hit != &apos;true&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# 👆 check if cache-hit happened then do not execute npm ci&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;npm ci&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;complete-workflow-yaml&quot;&gt;Complete Workflow Yaml&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.github\workflows\main.yml&lt;/code&gt; file and add below script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/44ebec690f2c01bf1df9b1d215a0e723.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-1st-build&quot;&gt;Creating 1st Build&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s create our first build by pushing change to GitHub. Since this is first time we are pushing build. Npm install will occur and total build time is more it is &lt;strong&gt;56s&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/J3MSIz3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cache-miss&quot;&gt;Cache Miss&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will notice our &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Cache node modules&lt;/code&gt; action will not be able to find the cache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/FbbUuCQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executing-install-dependencies-step&quot;&gt;Executing Install Dependencies Step&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since workflow could not find &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; in GitHub cache. It will install all node packages on &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Install Dependencies&lt;/code&gt; step. And notice &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Install Dependencies&lt;/code&gt; step took total &lt;strong&gt;18.878s&lt;/strong&gt;. Therefore, total build time will be around &lt;strong&gt;38s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/g6XaE9l.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-cache-saved-in-github&quot;&gt;New Cache Saved in GitHub&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the job is successful then Job cleanup process will execute. And during that phase &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Cache will be saved&lt;/code&gt;. The step name will be updated to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Post Cache node modules&lt;/code&gt; and will only execute once Job is successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/bughHIo.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This saved cache will be used in the next build. Stay tuned for the actual fun 😄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;triggering-2nd-build&quot;&gt;Triggering 2nd Build&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s do some change and push the build again. Notice since we did not change &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;package-lock.json&lt;/code&gt; file. Total Workflow Job time is &lt;strong&gt;34s&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/NNDepxy.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;restoring-node_modules-from-cache&quot;&gt;Restoring node_modules from cache&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, GitHub workflow will restore the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; from the cache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/Vatl4Sk.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;skipping-install-dependencies-step&quot;&gt;Skipping Install Dependencies Step&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, notice &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Install Dependencies&lt;/code&gt; step skipped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/OcsXLBk.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cache-hit-occurred&quot;&gt;Cache Hit Occurred&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once workflow is success &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cache&lt;/code&gt; action will print below info about the &lt;strong&gt;Cache Hit&lt;/strong&gt;. That proves that cache restoration happened successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/bdFN4QQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Post job cleanup.
Cache hit occurred on the primary key Linux-build-cache-node-modules-c473bbd9f33d84fd892675fbfce1a74d9c8b3f61d4e37c05ad92e29a23790116, not saving cache.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;changing-package-lockjson-file&quot;&gt;Changing Package-lock.json file&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you install or uninstall or update existing npm packages. Then &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;package-lock.json&lt;/code&gt; file will change and GitHub workflow will recreate the&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt; node_module&lt;/code&gt; cache.
Notice overall workflow executed in &lt;strong&gt;57s&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/BVBh2Z5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;installing-new-npm-package&quot;&gt;Installing new Npm Package&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/MlVbvDD.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;npm-dependencies-executed&quot;&gt;Npm Dependencies Executed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/9usffUQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you learned whenever &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;package-lock.json&lt;/code&gt; is changed workflow will be slow. However, in a team we rarely update &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;package-lcok.json&lt;/code&gt; file and you will get good speed at other builds where you only change the project files.&lt;/p&gt;

The main issue we face is npm install or npm ci which takes large amount of time to finish. Which slows-down the productivity of the team. With GitHub Workflows dependency caching you can reduce the install time to half. Therefore, in this article we will learn how can you leverage the GitHub caching workflow dependencies mechanism to improve speed and save network utilization or bandwidth of your build server.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/fucBPz6.gif" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/fucBPz6.gif" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Azure Information Protection Strategy</title><link href="https://www.rupeshtiwari.com/azure-information-protection-strategy/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Azure Information Protection Strategy" /><published>2021-06-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-06-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.rupeshtiwari.com/azure-information-protection-strategy</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.rupeshtiwari.com/azure-information-protection-strategy/">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Azure Information Protection (AIP)&lt;/strong&gt; is a cloud-based solution that enables organizations to &lt;strong&gt;classify&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;protect&lt;/strong&gt; documents and emails by applying &lt;strong&gt;labels&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-labels-apply-classification-with-aip&quot;&gt;How labels apply classification with AIP&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Labeling your content with AIP includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Classification&lt;/strong&gt; that can be detected regardless of where the data is stored or with whom it’s shared.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visual markings&lt;/strong&gt;, such as headers, footers, or watermarks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metadata&lt;/strong&gt;, added to files and email headers in clear text. The clear text metadata ensures that other services can identify the classification and take appropriate action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in the image below, labeling has classified an email message as &lt;em&gt;General&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/media/example-email-footerv2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sample email footer and headers showing Azure Information Protection classification&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-aip-protects-your-data&quot;&gt;How AIP protects your data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure Information Protection uses the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/what-is-azure-rms&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Azure Rights Management service&lt;/em&gt; (Azure RMS)&lt;/a&gt; to protect your data. Azure RMS uses encryption, identity, and authorization policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as the Azure Rights Management service is activated, two default rights management templates are available for you to restrict data access to users within your organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following image shows an example from the Exchange admin center, where you can configure Exchange Online mail flow rules to use RMS templates:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/media/templates-exchangeonline-callouts.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example of selecting templates for Exchange Online&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the AIP client enables users to classify and protect additional file types, or multiple files at once, using the right-click menu from Windows File Explorer. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8EUqnl7.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do Not Forward&lt;/strong&gt; functionality can be integrated into a label that users can select to apply both classification and protection to that email. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/media/recipients-only-label2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Selecting a label configured for Do Not Forward&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use one of the following methods to classify and protect existing content:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On-premises storage&lt;/strong&gt;: Use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/deploy-aip-scanner&quot;&gt;Azure Information Protection scanner&lt;/a&gt; to discover, classify, and protect documents on network shares and Microsoft SharePoint Server sites and libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud data storage&lt;/strong&gt;: Use &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-app-security/azip-integration&quot;&gt;Microsoft Cloud App Security&lt;/a&gt; to apply your labels to documents in Box, SharePoint, and OneDrive.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--success&quot;&gt;🏆 &lt;strong&gt;ProTip&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What are the default labels for classification in Azure Information Protection?&lt;/strong&gt;
Personal, Public, General, Confidential, and Highly Confidential&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Do you want to create your own custom &lt;strong&gt;GitHub Action&lt;/strong&gt;? It’s very simple &amp;amp; really fun! In this article I will walk you through the steps to &lt;strong&gt;write, test, and deploy&lt;/strong&gt; your own &lt;strong&gt;JavaScript&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-started&quot;&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s setup our Machine and Project first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pre-requisites&quot;&gt;Pre-requisites&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since you want to create JavaScript GitHub Actions make sure you have installed &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;node.js&lt;/code&gt; in your machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;creating-github-actions-project&quot;&gt;Creating GitHub Actions Project&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create simple &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;node.j&lt;/code&gt;s project by executing following scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;mkdir &lt;/span&gt;hello-world-javascript-action
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;hello-world-javascript-action
npm init &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-y&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; add &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;node_modules/&lt;/code&gt; there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-action-file&quot;&gt;Creating Action File&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s create schema of our custom &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;action.yml&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defining-action-schema&quot;&gt;Defining Action Schema&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;action.yml&lt;/code&gt; at the root of the project and add below script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;World&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;someone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;record&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;time&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;inputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;who-to-greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# id of input&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Who&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;greet&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;required&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;World&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;outputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# id of output&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;The&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;we&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;greeted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;you&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;runs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;using&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;node12&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;index.js&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;installing-github-actions-npm-packages&quot;&gt;Installing GitHub actions npm Packages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need GitHub Actions &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;core&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;github&lt;/code&gt; packages to write our custom action. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@actions/core&lt;/code&gt; helps to get input and set output value in workflow. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@actions/github&lt;/code&gt; helps us to get the entire payload of the GitHub action. Run below script to install them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i @actions/core @actions/github
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;writing-our-custom-action-behavior&quot;&gt;Writing our Custom Action Behavior&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we will write JavaScript code to add the custom behavior to our custom action. Create index.js at the root of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;core&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;@actions/core&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;github&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;@actions/github&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nameToGreet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;core&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;who-to-greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`Hello &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nameToGreet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toTimeString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;core&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;setOutput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;payload&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;github&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;payload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`The event payload: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;payload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;core&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;setFailed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;compiling-action&quot;&gt;Compiling Action&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we need to compile our action into single JavaScript file that includes all of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;node_module&lt;/code&gt; source code that we are referring in our &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;installing-vercel-npm-package&quot;&gt;Installing Vercel npm package&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vercel/ncc?activeTab=dependents&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@vercel/ncc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Npm package help us to bundle up our code as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt; including all dependencies and create &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;license.txt&lt;/code&gt; file as well inside the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dist&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run below script to install &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@vercel/ncc&lt;/code&gt; globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i -g @vercel/ncc

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;compiling-code&quot;&gt;Compiling code&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ncc build index.js --license licenses.txt&lt;/code&gt; to compile code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/8cLYdjh.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;testing-local-action-from-github-workflow&quot;&gt;Testing Local Action from GitHub Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before actually deploying code to GitHub Actions publicly. I would prefer to test it once. Therefore, let’s push our code and create a workflow to user our own action from this repository only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;referring-to-compiled-local-action&quot;&gt;Referring to Compiled Local Action&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now lets test our own action from the workflow by referring to the repository &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;action.yml&lt;/code&gt; file only.
We will refer to the compiled &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt; file in our own repo. Change the main keyword in your &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;action.yml&lt;/code&gt; file to use the new &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dist/index.js&lt;/code&gt; file. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;main: &apos;dist/index.js&apos;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;World&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;someone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;record&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;time&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;inputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;who-to-greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# id of input&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Who&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;greet&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;required&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;creating-github-workflow&quot;&gt;Creating GitHub Workflow&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.github\workflows\main.yml&lt;/code&gt; and add below script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# To use this repository&apos;s private action,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# you must check out the repository&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;who-to-greet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Rupesh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Tiwari&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Use the output from the `hello` step&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Get the output time&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;echo &quot;The time was $&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;triggering-our-local-github-action&quot;&gt;Triggering our Local GitHub Action&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s commit and push our code at this point to trigger local action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;commit-and-push-your-code&quot;&gt;Commit and Push your code&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To trigger your custom action commit and push the code by running below scripts on command terminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git add action.yml index.js node_modules/&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; package.json package-lock.json README.md
git commit &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;My first action is ready&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
git push
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/1kS1TlZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice 👆 our workflow success and action executed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;publishing-your-action-to-public&quot;&gt;Publishing your Action to Public&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this is the time to make our action public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tag-and-push-your-action-to-github&quot;&gt;tag and push your action to GitHub&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order for making our action public we must tag and push to GitHub that’s it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git add action.yml index.js node_modules/&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; package.json package-lock.json README.md
git commit &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;My first action is ready&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
git tag &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;My first action release&quot;&lt;/span&gt; v1
git push &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--follow-tags&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/hx55QGL.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;testing-your-public-action-in-workflow&quot;&gt;Testing your Public Action in Workflow&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change the workflow to use your public action &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;actions/hello-world-javascript-action@v1.1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;jobs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;hello_world_job&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Hello world action step&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Use the output from the `hello` step&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Get the output time&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;triggering-your-published-action&quot;&gt;Triggering Your Published Action&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again push your code and notice our public action is triggered as well Hurray! Time for party 🍕 !&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Azure Load Balancer evenly distributes incoming network traffic load among backend resources or servers. It works at layer 4 (Transport Layer) of OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model. Inbound load flows from frontend to backend instances of load balancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/LgrTV0m.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;load-balancer-types&quot;&gt;Load Balancer Types&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are Basic and Standard Azure Load Balancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;scope-of-load-balancers&quot;&gt;Scope of Load Balancers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public Load Balancer and Private Load Balancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;load-balancer-components&quot;&gt;Load Balancer Components&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Frontend IP configuration - Public and Private IP Address.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Backend Pool&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Health Probes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Load-Balancing Rules&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;High Availability Ports&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inbound NAT rules&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Outbound Rules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;frontend-ip-configuration&quot;&gt;Frontend IP Configuration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the IP address for Load Balancer where clients can connect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/hHZDVTs.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 2 types:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public IP Address&lt;/strong&gt; is public IP &amp;amp; Port for incoming traffic from the internet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private IP Address&lt;/strong&gt; is the IP and Port never exposed to the internet &amp;amp; only exposed to the VMs internal to the VNet (Virtual Network)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;backend-pool&quot;&gt;Backend Pool&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backend pool is all of the groups of VMs or VM scale set inside the VNet serving the incoming request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;health-probes&quot;&gt;Health Probes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health Probes explains the health status of the instances in the given backend pool. It supports TCP, HTTP and HTTPs. Basic Load Balancer can’t support HTTPS probes and only support TCP health probes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;load-balancing-rules&quot;&gt;Load Balancing Rules&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Load Balancing rules define the rule for a port to route the traffic from frontend IP to port of your backend instances of VNet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/pFUEwjM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, you can create a rule to route all traffic from frontend IP port 80 to route to backend pool instances port 80.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;high-available-ports&quot;&gt;High Available Ports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is only available for Standard load balancer to manage large number of request and having large set of VMs. Here you define a rule &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;protocol -all and port -0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/mBhdukf.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This single rule to load balance all TCP &amp;amp; UDP flows that arrives to all ports of an internal standard load balancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;inbound-nat-rules&quot;&gt;Inbound NAT rules&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/FTVE47y.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a rule to forward any incoming traffic sent to frontend IP address and port combination to a specific backend pool instances or VMs within a VNet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;outbound-rules&quot;&gt;Outbound rules&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/iEgMAz8.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It configures outbound Network Address Mapping for all VMs or instances in a backend pool within a VNet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;limitations&quot;&gt;Limitations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to understand any concept concretely you must know its limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are the limitations of Azure Load Balancers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Forwarding rules are only for TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) no support for ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Outbound flow from a backend VM to a frontend IP of internal load balancer will fail.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can only have 1 public and internal load balancer for single Availability Set.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both frontends and backend’s instances must be within the same Virtual Network (VNet). Since, load balancer rules can’t span across 3 VNets.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/aTyuJ9D.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You can use Standard Load Balancer to be zonal redundant for high availability however they must be within single VNet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;knowledge-check-&quot;&gt;Knowledge Check 👨‍🏫&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many Virtual Networks can a load balancer connect? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Correct Answer:&lt;/strong&gt; only 1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At which OSI Layer does an Azure load balancer operate? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Correct Answer:&lt;/strong&gt; Layer 4 (Transport Layer) of OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Are you wondering how to publish &lt;strong&gt;Test Results&lt;/strong&gt; over &lt;strong&gt;Azure CI Build&lt;/strong&gt; while using &lt;strong&gt;Angular&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;JEST&lt;/strong&gt;? In this article I will demonstrate &lt;strong&gt;nx monorepo&lt;/strong&gt; publishing test results using &lt;strong&gt;azure pipeline&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are u are using Karma Test Runner then read my previous article &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rupeshtiwari.com/publishing-nx-monorepo-test-results-in-azure-ci-pipeline/&quot;&gt;Publishing Nx Monorepo Test Results in Azure CI Pipeline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/XwPm3dn.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;azure-publish-test-results-task&quot;&gt;Azure Publish Test Results Task&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am using &lt;strong&gt;Azure CI build&lt;/strong&gt; to build, test and deploy my Angular App.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;azure-publish-test-result-task-name&quot;&gt;Azure Publish Test Result Task Name&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will use Azure Task &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PublishTestResults@2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to publish our angular test results to &lt;strong&gt;Azure Pipelines&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;supported-test-results-formats&quot;&gt;Supported Test Results Formats&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of now Azure Task only supports below Test Result formats:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;JUnit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;NUnit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;VSTest&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;xUnit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cTest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will use &lt;strong&gt;JUnit&lt;/strong&gt; format to publish Angular Test Result. Also just let you know that Azure The default option uses JUnit format to publish test results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;generating-test-results-in-angular-app&quot;&gt;Generating Test Results in Angular App&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we run test in Angular App Test Results files are supposed to be created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;installing-jest-junit-npm-package&quot;&gt;Installing Jest-JUnit npm Package&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we are using JEST let’s install &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-junit&quot;&gt;jest-junit&lt;/a&gt; in our angular app first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/LqZMBCh.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run below script on root of your project where you see package.json file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm i &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-D&lt;/span&gt; jest-junit
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;updating-jestconfig&quot;&gt;Updating Jest.Config&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s define the JUnit Reporter config inside the Jest.Config file. Here I will define &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;outputDirectory&lt;/code&gt; , &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;outputName&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;suiteName&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; reporters: [
    &apos;default&apos;,
    [
      &apos;jest-junit&apos;,
      {
        outputDirectory: &apos;test_results&apos;,
        outputName: &apos;jest-junit.xml&apos;,
        suiteName: &apos;Angular Inventions Tests&apos;
      },
    ],
  ],
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;creating-test-script&quot;&gt;Creating Test Script&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to generate report we have to run the test. Add below test script in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-json highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;scripts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;test:prod&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;jest --ci&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;generating-test-results&quot;&gt;Generating Test Results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s Run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm run test:prod&lt;/code&gt; and notice our test is passing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/GZQZxhI.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as test report created under folder &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;test_results&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/kVq7uZ2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;azure-pipeline-update&quot;&gt;Azure Pipeline Update&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order for publishing your test results on azure pipelines. You can setup your &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;azure-pipelines.yml&lt;/code&gt; for showing test results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;publish-test-results-yaml&quot;&gt;Publish Test Results YAML&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;PublishTestResults@2&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;enabled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;displayName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;Publish Test Results&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;inputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;testResultsFormat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;JUnit&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;testResultsFiles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;**/test_results/jest-junit.xml&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;mergeTestResults&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Azure Information Protection (AIP)&lt;/strong&gt; is a cloud-based solution that enables organizations to &lt;strong&gt;classify&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;protect&lt;/strong&gt; documents and emails by applying &lt;strong&gt;labels&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-labels-apply-classification-with-aip&quot;&gt;How labels apply classification with AIP&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Labeling your content with AIP includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Classification&lt;/strong&gt; that can be detected regardless of where the data is stored or with whom it’s shared.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visual markings&lt;/strong&gt;, such as headers, footers, or watermarks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metadata&lt;/strong&gt;, added to files and email headers in clear text. The clear text metadata ensures that other services can identify the classification and take appropriate action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in the image below, labeling has classified an email message as &lt;em&gt;General&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/media/example-email-footerv2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sample email footer and headers showing Azure Information Protection classification&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-aip-protects-your-data&quot;&gt;How AIP protects your data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure Information Protection uses the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/what-is-azure-rms&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Azure Rights Management service&lt;/em&gt; (Azure RMS)&lt;/a&gt; to protect your data. Azure RMS uses encryption, identity, and authorization policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as the Azure Rights Management service is activated, two default rights management templates are available for you to restrict data access to users within your organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following image shows an example from the Exchange admin center, where you can configure Exchange Online mail flow rules to use RMS templates:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/media/templates-exchangeonline-callouts.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example of selecting templates for Exchange Online&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the AIP client enables users to classify and protect additional file types, or multiple files at once, using the right-click menu from Windows File Explorer. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8EUqnl7.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do Not Forward&lt;/strong&gt; functionality can be integrated into a label that users can select to apply both classification and protection to that email. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/media/recipients-only-label2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Selecting a label configured for Do Not Forward&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use one of the following methods to classify and protect existing content:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On-premises storage&lt;/strong&gt;: Use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/deploy-aip-scanner&quot;&gt;Azure Information Protection scanner&lt;/a&gt; to discover, classify, and protect documents on network shares and Microsoft SharePoint Server sites and libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud data storage&lt;/strong&gt;: Use &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-app-security/azip-integration&quot;&gt;Microsoft Cloud App Security&lt;/a&gt; to apply your labels to documents in Box, SharePoint, and OneDrive.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--success&quot;&gt;🏆 &lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What are the default labels for classification in Azure Information Protection?&lt;/strong&gt;
Personal, Public, General, Confidential, and Highly Confidential&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Match&lt;/code&gt; is used in string and it uses regular expression to search in string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-powershell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;c:\temp\web\config.js&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;b\\config.js&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MtYadup.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Like&lt;/code&gt; is used in string and it uses wild card search&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jgeLl0t.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever error occurs in batch file it save the error code in the environment variable &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;%ERRORLEVEL%&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Return Code:&quot;&lt;/span&gt; %ERRORLEVEL%

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ZipFile.ExtractToDirectory()&lt;/code&gt; is .Net Framework 4.5 built-in api.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-powershell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System.IO.Compression.ZipFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ExtractToDirectory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;c:\fsms\test.zip&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;c:\fsms\unpack&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-foldercopyhere-method-of-shellapplication-class&quot;&gt;Using Folder.CopyHere() Method of Shell.Application Class&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;COM object&lt;/code&gt; created from &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Shell.Application&lt;/code&gt; class. Use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;namespace().items()&lt;/code&gt; to get all items then copy them to destination folder. Make sure destination folder exist before you copy. Also this way of un-archiving files seems lil lengthy. However, I found that COM method to un-archive files are reliable since it is not modifying the modified date time of the files inside the zip file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--success&quot;&gt;🏆 &lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For example if there is a file called as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Web.config&lt;/code&gt; inside your &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;web.zip\Content\website&lt;/code&gt; folder. Then if the actual modified date time is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;5/4/2021 07:00:11 AM&lt;/code&gt; then this will show exact same time. However, if u use powershell cmdlet &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Expand-Archive&lt;/code&gt; or .Net &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ExtractToDirectory&lt;/code&gt; methods they will sometime display &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;+1&lt;/code&gt; hour so they will show file &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;lastwritetime&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;5/4/2021 08:00:11 AM&lt;/code&gt;. Note here it is showing &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;8AM&lt;/code&gt; rather &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;7AM&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-powershell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$shell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;new-object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Shell.Application&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$targetFolderToCopyUnzippedFiles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;c:\fsms\unpack&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# create a target folder if not exist. Make sure you have the folder otherwise un-archive will fail.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;test-path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$targetFolderToCopyUnzippedFiles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;new-item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-itemtype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;directory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$targetFolderToCopyUnzippedFiles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-force&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-azure&quot;&gt;What is Azure?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure is a continually expanding set of cloud services that help your organization meet your current and future business challenges. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-fundamentals/what-is-microsoft-azure&quot;&gt;Learn More about What is Microsoft Azure here…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-azure-fundamentals&quot;&gt;What is Azure fundamentals?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure fundamentals is a series of &lt;a href=&quot;#exam-az-900&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;six learning paths&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or six knowledge domain areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-should-i-take-azure-fundamentals&quot;&gt;Why should I take Azure fundamentals?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You boss or manager wants to use Azure in your company. So you must be prepare for it. Now a days there are many jobs available which requires Azure certifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take Azure fundamentals if you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have general interest in Azure or in the cloud.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-cloud-computing&quot;&gt;What is cloud computing?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the &lt;strong&gt;delivery of computing services over the internet&lt;/strong&gt;, which is otherwise known as the cloud. These services include servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence. Cloud computing offers faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--success&quot;&gt;🏆 &lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Save your company money 💰 “You’ll only need to pay for &lt;strong&gt;the resources and computing time that you use&lt;/strong&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-is-cloud-computing-typically-cheaper-to-use&quot;&gt;Why is cloud computing typically cheaper to use?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet by using a &lt;strong&gt;pay-as-you-go&lt;/strong&gt; pricing model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put it another way, cloud computing is a way to &lt;strong&gt;rent compute power and storage&lt;/strong&gt; from someone else’s datacenter. You can treat cloud resources like you would your resources in your own datacenter. When you’re done using them, you give them back. You’re billed only for what you use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of maintaining CPUs and storage in your datacenter, you rent them for the time that you need them. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cloud provider&lt;/code&gt; takes care of &lt;strong&gt;maintaining the underlying infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt; for you. The cloud enables you to quickly solve your toughest business challenges, and bring cutting-edge solutions to your users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-should-you-move-to-the-cloud&quot;&gt;Why should You move to the cloud?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our ever-changing digital world, two trends emerge:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Teams &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;deliver&lt;/code&gt; new features to their users at &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;record speeds&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Users expect an increasingly &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rich and immersive experience&lt;/code&gt; with their devices and with software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cloud provides on-demand access to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A nearly limitless pool of raw compute, storage, and networking components.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Speech recognition and other cognitive services that help make your application stand out from the crowd.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Analytics services that deliver telemetry data from your software and devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-are-some-cloud-computing-advantages&quot;&gt;What are some cloud computing advantages?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--success&quot;&gt;🏆 &lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember the sentence &lt;a href=&quot;https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/gashed&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GASHED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt; = &lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt;eo-distribution
&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; = &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;gility
&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt; = &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;calability
&lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt; = &lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt;igh availability
&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt; = &lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;lasticity
&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; = &lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;isaster recovery&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👇 Below are also called as cloud concepts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geo-distribution&lt;/strong&gt;: You can deploy apps and data to regional datacenters around the globe, thereby ensuring that your customers always have the best performance in their region.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agility&lt;/strong&gt;: Deploy and configure cloud-based resources quickly as your app requirements change.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scalability&lt;/strong&gt;: Apps in the cloud can scale &lt;em&gt;vertically&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;horizontally&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Scale vertically to increase compute capacity by adding RAM or CPUs to a virtual machine.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Scaling horizontally increases compute capacity by adding instances of resources, such as adding VMs to the configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High availability&lt;/strong&gt;: Depending on the service-level agreement (SLA) that you choose, your cloud-based apps can provide a continuous user experience with no apparent downtime, even when things go wrong. This is also called as &lt;strong&gt;Reliability&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elasticity&lt;/strong&gt;: You can configure cloud-based apps to take advantage of autoscaling, so your apps always have the resources they need. It can decrease resource if they are underused or increase if demand is high.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaster recovery&lt;/strong&gt;: By taking advantage of cloud-based backup services, data replication, and geo-distribution, you can deploy your apps with the confidence that comes from knowing that your data is safe in the event of disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-are-cloud-service-models&quot;&gt;What are cloud service models?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 3 Cloud Service Models:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)&lt;/strong&gt; the cloud provider will keep the hardware up-to-date, but operating system maintenance and network configuration is up to you as the cloud tenant.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)&lt;/strong&gt; the cloud provider manages the virtual machines and networking resources, and the cloud tenant deploys their applications into the managed hosting environment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software-as-a-Service(SaaS)&lt;/strong&gt; the cloud provider manages all aspects of the application environment, such as virtual machines, networking resources, data storage, and applications. The cloud tenant only needs to provide their data to the application managed by the cloud provider.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following illustration demonstrates the services that might run in each of the cloud service models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/Ia6D7IM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following chart illustrates the various levels of responsibility between a cloud provider and a cloud tenant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/tCJ0p7V.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-serverless-computing&quot;&gt;What is serverless computing?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a PaaS model. Normally used by developers to build applications faster. With serverless applications, the cloud service provider automatically provisions, scales, and manages the infrastructure required to run the code. Serverless architectures are highly scalable and event-driven, only using resources when a specific function or trigger occurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--success&quot;&gt;🏆 &lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The “serverless” name comes from the fact that the tasks associated with infrastructure provisioning and management are invisible to the developer. This approach enables developers to increase their focus on the business logic, and deliver more value to the core of the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-are-public-private-and-hybrid-clouds&quot;&gt;What are public, private, and hybrid clouds?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three deployment models:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public cloud&lt;/strong&gt; is cloud resources, such as servers and storage, are &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider&lt;/code&gt;, and delivered over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private cloud&lt;/strong&gt; consists of computing resources used exclusively by &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;users from one business or organization&lt;/code&gt;. A private cloud can be physically located at your organization’s on-site (on-premises) datacenter, or it can be hosted by a third-party service provider.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hybrid cloud&lt;/strong&gt; is a computing environment that combines a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;public cloud and a private cloud&lt;/code&gt; by allowing data and applications to be shared between them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/6DirYOj.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-azure-works&quot;&gt;How Azure Works?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/S2EB0iV.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure works with technology called &lt;strong&gt;Virtualization&lt;/strong&gt;. Means separates the tight coupling between Hardware and its operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/n2HRQdJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It uses &lt;strong&gt;Hypervisor&lt;/strong&gt; to abstract away the coupling between hardware &amp;amp; software using Virtualization technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xS7cXdH.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure has lots of Data Centers in many regions spread around the world. Azure uses virtualization in massive scale in all of its data-centers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data-center&lt;/strong&gt; has &lt;strong&gt;Rack&lt;/strong&gt; and Rack has servers. Each server includes Hypervisor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;strong&gt;Network Switch&lt;/strong&gt; which allows connectivity to all of the servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2urDTsz.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One server&lt;/strong&gt; in the rack runs special software called as &lt;strong&gt;Fabric Controller&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Y32nDX0.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure Fabric Controller is connected to &lt;strong&gt;ORCHESTRATOR&lt;/strong&gt; software. An Orchestrator responds to user requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--success&quot;&gt;🏆 &lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In-fact &lt;strong&gt;Azure Orchestrator&lt;/strong&gt; manages everything that happens in Azure. Like it can package the Virtual Machine request coming from user and send to Azure Fabric Controller to create it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TfOkyJV.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The users can make requests using the &lt;strong&gt;Orchestrators Web API&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/o3Ol9NR.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Web API&lt;/strong&gt; can be called using &lt;strong&gt;Azure Portal&lt;/strong&gt; and many tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/tDjFTKJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For example&lt;/strong&gt;, when a user makes a request to create a Virtual Machine (VM) from Azure portal. The Orchestrator packages everything needed and chooses the best server Rack. And then sends the package and request to the Fabric Controller. Once the Fabric Controller has created the Virtual Machine, the user can connect to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/E80cISJ.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;azure-portal&quot;&gt;Azure Portal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Azure portal is a web-based, unified console that provides an alternative to command-line tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/&quot;&gt;Azure Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; helps connect users with Microsoft partners, independent software vendors, and startups that are offering their solutions and services, which are optimized to run on Azure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3Vabs2f.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure Marketplace is an online store that hosts applications that are certified and optimized to run in Azure. Many types of applications are available, ranging from AI and machine learning to web applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;azure-services&quot;&gt;Azure Services&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a quick tour of the high-level services Azure offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;databases&quot;&gt;Databases&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure provides multiple database services to store a wide variety of data types and volumes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cosmos DB&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MySQL&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Cosmos DB vs Table Storage&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Cosmos DB&lt;/strong&gt; has 99.999% SLA, supports &lt;strong&gt;many NoSQL APIs&lt;/strong&gt;, variations of &lt;strong&gt;NoSQL storage&lt;/strong&gt; – Document, Graph, Key-Value and Tabular. However, &lt;strong&gt;Table Storage&lt;/strong&gt; is just for NoSQL documents and cheaper than Cosmos DB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure Storage Benefits are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; = &lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;urable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt; = &lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;anaged&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; = &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;ccessible&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt; = &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;ecure&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use existing data to focus future behaviors using AI. Use Machine learning to build train and deploy model to cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence &lt;strong&gt;(AI)&lt;/strong&gt; 🅰️ &lt;br /&gt;
For example, when you shop online, machine learning helps recommend other products you might like based on what you’ve purchased. Or when your credit card is swiped, machine learning compares the transaction to a database of transactions and helps detect fraud. And when your robot vacuum cleaner vacuums a room, machine learning helps it decide whether the job is done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-the-azure-account&quot;&gt;What is the Azure account?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create and use Azure services, you need an Azure subscription. When you create an &lt;strong&gt;Azure account&lt;/strong&gt; then Azure subscription will be created automatically for you. You’re free to create additional subscriptions. Next, you can start creating Azure resources within each subscription.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--success&quot;&gt;🏆 &lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You &lt;strong&gt;don’t need to purchase an Azure account&lt;/strong&gt; before you can use any Azure resources. Because, You can use a free Azure account or a Microsoft Learn sandbox to create resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/fV0lcsb.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-the-azure-free-account&quot;&gt;What is the Azure free account?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Azure free account includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Free access to popular Azure &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;products&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;12 months&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;credit&lt;/code&gt; to spend for the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;first 30 days&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Access to more than &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;25 products&lt;/code&gt; that are &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;always free&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-the-learn-sandbox&quot;&gt;What is the Learn sandbox?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maximum &lt;strong&gt;Learn&lt;/strong&gt; exercises use a technology called the &lt;strong&gt;sandbox&lt;/strong&gt;, which creates a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;temporary subscription&lt;/code&gt; that’s added to your Azure account. Learn automatically cleans up the temporary resources for you after you’ve completed the module. The sandbox is the preferred method to use though, because it allows you to create and test Azure resources at no cost to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/Nc5EvmZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;align--left&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://status.azure.com/en-us/status&quot;&gt;Azure Status&lt;/a&gt; generates all global Azure service status. Azure Service Health broadly check 4 different kind of health categories like:
&lt;a href=&quot;#planned-maintenance&quot;&gt;Planned Maintenance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#health-advisories&quot;&gt;Health Advisories&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#security-advisories&quot;&gt;Security Advisories&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#service-issues&quot;&gt;Service Issues&lt;/a&gt;. Azure Health also allows you to configure health alerts based on above categories events. You can also add action groups to either email or SMS or phone call on desired health events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--success&quot;&gt;🏆 &lt;strong&gt;ProTip&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Azure Service Health is: &lt;strong&gt;Planned, Health &amp;amp; Security, Service&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;mermaid&quot;&gt;
graph TD;
    A(Azure Service Health)--&amp;gt;P(Planned Maintenance);
    A--&amp;gt;H(Health Advisories);
    A--&amp;gt;S2(Security Advisories);
    A--&amp;gt;S(Service Issues);
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;planned-maintenance&quot;&gt;Planned Maintenance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find planned maintenance in Azure and notify your clients of an up coming events or reschedule an up coming release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;health-advisories&quot;&gt;Health Advisories&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changes in Azure Service that require your attention. For example, if features in a service that you use are being deprecated or you need to upgrade your web application because a framework version in Azure App Service is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;security-advisories&quot;&gt;Security Advisories&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notifications or violations that may affect availability of your Azure services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;service-issues&quot;&gt;Service Issues&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Azure portal Azure Service Health list down all the service issues that may impact you based on your resources in use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;azure-monitor&quot;&gt;Azure Monitor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure Monitor is a solution within Azure for collecting and analyzing telemetry from your Azure or on-premises resources.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Have you tried to host &lt;strong&gt;NServiceBus&lt;/strong&gt; within &lt;strong&gt;Azure Functions&lt;/strong&gt;? In this article I will teach you how can you host your first NServiceBus project within Azure Functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, I will use &lt;strong&gt;.net core 3.1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/v3Swm7Q.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pre-requisite&quot;&gt;Pre-requisite&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to follow this article and coding along with me you need to have below things ready.
You must have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visual Studio Installed, I am using VS2019 premium.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure you installed Azure Development workload ( need machine restart after installing )&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must have your Azure Account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-nservice-bus-in-azure-if-azure-service-bus-is-there&quot;&gt;Why NService Bus in Azure if Azure Service Bus is there?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might have this question why to use NService Bus in Azure Service Bus? Well the answer is simple&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NServiceBus (NSB)&lt;/strong&gt; gives an &lt;strong&gt;abstraction&lt;/strong&gt; to create your handlers using &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IHandleMessages&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; interface.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No boilerplate code required&lt;/strong&gt;. When a message comes to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Azure Function&lt;/code&gt; then you must not write much code to invoke your NSB Message handlers. It’s all taken care by NSB only.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extensible Message Processing Pipeline&lt;/strong&gt; You can take the advantages of this feature also.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooling&lt;/strong&gt; NSB provides tooling like &lt;strong&gt;AppInsight&lt;/strong&gt; , &lt;strong&gt;Service Control&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Service Pulse&lt;/strong&gt; to track your messages and retry failed one manually. Check health of your handlers etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NSB&lt;/strong&gt; framework &lt;strong&gt;enables to publish base messages once the child message is published&lt;/strong&gt;. Example if &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AccountCreatedV2&lt;/code&gt; Message inherits from &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AccountCreatedV1&lt;/code&gt; class. And if we publish &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AccountCreatedV2&lt;/code&gt; event then NSB will also publish the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AccountCreatedV1&lt;/code&gt; event so that both message handlers will be invoked out of the box.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NSB&lt;/strong&gt; also help us to route all of the messages sitting in the dead-letter queues to corresponding destinations or receivers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NSB&lt;/strong&gt; uses &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sendvia&lt;/code&gt; feature and creates default topology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-started-with-nsb-sample-code&quot;&gt;Getting Started with NSB Sample code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s try to host the NService Bus in Azure Function and get the sample code from below URL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;download-nsb-sample-code&quot;&gt;Download NSB Sample Code&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download code: https://docs.particular.net/samples/previews/azure-functions/service-bus/
Open the source code on Visual Studio. It look like below.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/1iaoHyY.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-nsb-dev-license&quot;&gt;Getting NSB Dev License&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need license in order to run NSB Message Handlers on Azure. Get the NSB free trial development 90 days license from here https://particular.net/license/nservicebus?v=7.2.3&amp;amp;t=0&amp;amp;p=windows. You can always renew your development license. Once you have the license xml file then do below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Escape all double quotes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make them single line string value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next go to the Visual Studio &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;local.settings.json&lt;/code&gt; file and add the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NSERVICEBUS_LICENSE&lt;/code&gt; in values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-json highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;IsEncrypted&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;Values&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;NSERVICEBUS_LICENSE&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&amp;lt;?xml version=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; encoding=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;utf-8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;?&amp;gt;&amp;lt;license id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;1222e1d1-2222-4a46-b1c6-943c442ca710&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; expiration=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;2113-11-30T00:00:00.0000000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Standard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; LicenseType=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Standard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; LicenseVersion=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;4.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; MaxMessageThroughputPerSecond=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; WorkerThreads=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; AllowedNumberOfWorkerNodes=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;. . .&amp;lt;/license&amp;gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-azure-queue&quot;&gt;Creating Azure Queue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NSB will not create azure queue. You must create them manually. Either you can create them by going to your &lt;a href=&quot;https://portal.azure.com&quot;&gt;Azure Portal&lt;/a&gt; or using &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?tabs=azure-cli&quot;&gt;Azure CLI&lt;/a&gt;. I will go to my azure portal and create it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;N-Service Bus creates Queue &amp;amp; setup Topology when you call below method. However, this works only for Website. However, when you host N-Service Bus in Azure Functions it will not create Queue. Which is going to be fixed soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-csharp highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;endpointConfiguration&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;EndpointConfiguration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;connection&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;endpointConfiguration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;EnableInstaller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;create-a-azure-service-bus-resource&quot;&gt;Create a Azure Service Bus Resource&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need Azure Service Bus Resource under that resource we will create Azure Queue. We will use the Queue to put the message and trigger Azure Functions on message arrival on queue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/Wibu8s0.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;creating-azure-queue-used-by-nsb&quot;&gt;Creating Azure Queue used by NSB&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next I will crate Azure Queue named as “&lt;strong&gt;ASBTriggerQueue&lt;/strong&gt;”. Whenever HTTP message will arrive we will trigger Azure Functions. That will add the message in to the Azure Queue. Therefore, we are creating our Azure Queue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/39sUcJY.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;creating-asb-shared-access-policies&quot;&gt;Creating ASB Shared Access Policies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to create Azure Service Bus &lt;strong&gt;Shared Access Policy&lt;/strong&gt; call it &lt;strong&gt;devtest&lt;/strong&gt; under our Azure Service Bus resource to restrict only &lt;strong&gt;Read&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Listen&lt;/strong&gt; behavior of the queue. Next we can get the connection string of this queue from the SAS policy. Basically whichever Azure Function App will use this connection string they can Listen and Read the messages from this queue.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/WZwE413.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;azure-queue-connection-string&quot;&gt;Azure Queue Connection String&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Head on to the Azure Shared Access Policy for Azure Service Bus. Then copy the Primary Connection String.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/N0d7PwE.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then open Visual Studio project go to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;local.settings.json&lt;/code&gt; and paste the connection string at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AzureWebJobsServiceBus&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/Mb8gnAH.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we are ready to Go! 🏃&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;running-nsb-azure-function-locally&quot;&gt;Running NSB Azure Function Locally&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Visual Studio select the First Project at debug and run project for debugging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/UIOcGiH.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/v3Swm7Q.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next navigate to below URL so that our HttpSender Azure Function will be triggered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;http://localhost:7071/api/HttpSender&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/WVssCwa.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;deploying-nsb-functions-to-azure&quot;&gt;Deploying NSB Functions to Azure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now lets deploy our NSB functions to Azure. In My personal Account, I will deploy the Function app &amp;amp; update the app configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;publishing-function-to-azure&quot;&gt;Publishing Function to Azure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open Visual Studio and right click you project and publish the App to Azure. Go to your &lt;a href=&quot;https://portal.azure.com/&quot;&gt;Azure Portal&lt;/a&gt; and Confirm that you got your functions deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/rQ1Zoj4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;adding-configuration-settings&quot;&gt;Adding Configuration Settings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we must add the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AzureWebJobServiceBus&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NSERVICEBUS_LICENSE&lt;/code&gt; values in Azure portal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/TRwk8J1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;triggering-nsb-on-azure&quot;&gt;Triggering NSB on Azure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to invoke the &lt;strong&gt;HttpSender Function&lt;/strong&gt; you must need Invoking URL and &lt;strong&gt;Function Key&lt;/strong&gt; since we are using &lt;strong&gt;Function Authorization&lt;/strong&gt;. To get the Function Key:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click on the HttpSender Azure function on the Azure portal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Next Select Function Keys and copy the default function key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next append the &lt;strong&gt;Function Key&lt;/strong&gt; on your azure invocation URL. https://azurefunctionsasbtriggerfunctionshostbuilder-rupesh.azurewebsites.net/api/httpsender?code=YOURFUNCTIONKEY&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/FBcOAIY.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open the browser and navigate to the invocation URL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;monitoring-azure-functions-live&quot;&gt;Monitoring Azure Functions Live&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next you can see all of your &lt;strong&gt;Azure Functions logs&lt;/strong&gt; messages live in Azure portal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;strong&gt;Azure Function App&lt;/strong&gt; on Azure Portal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select &lt;strong&gt;Log Stream&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/fSfU5nh.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if you again invoke by navigating to URL you will see live log here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/muioplL.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When I was learning Azure Infrastructure, I had big question in my mind what is subnet and why do I need Subnet in my network? If you share my question then here is the article for you! Everything you must know about subnet as a beginner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-subnetting&quot;&gt;What is Subnetting?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sub + Network&lt;/strong&gt; = &lt;strong&gt;Subnet&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You company has one Network that runs your company. You want to break the Network in to small pieces called as Sub Network which is Subnet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kPADsyV.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;align-left&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You buy whole one pizza. However, you eat them in slices, so it is easier to you eat. So you divide you pizza into slices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have one whole network you divide them in smaller network. So that you can manage them easily and organize them better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-we-need-to-subnet-a-network&quot;&gt;Why do we need to Subnet a Network?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 3 main reasons, why you want to subnet a network:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Security 👮&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Organization 🏛️&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Performance 🏃&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-security&quot;&gt;👮 Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have secure, high confidential data in network that you don’t want them to be shared to anyone. It could be your top secrete company project. Your company employees personal records etc. Therefore, your network security is very important. And Subnetting to your network brings security to your Network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;️-organization&quot;&gt;🏛️ Organization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can take each subnet and assign to different department of your company. For example, you distribute your subnet among IT department, HR department, Sales team etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-performance&quot;&gt;🏃 Performance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Subnet is small therefore, it give better performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we connect multiple subnets to each other? Answer is via &lt;a href=&quot;#router&quot;&gt;router&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;router&quot;&gt;Router&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/EkPubq2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A router is a network device that connects different networks together. Each network is signified by it’s network id or area code. You can use router to connect your subnets as well.&lt;mark&gt; Each subnet want to communicate to other subnet must go through the Router. &lt;/mark&gt;. Router acts as a gateway and it has default gateway number for each subnet. So each &lt;a href=&quot;#host&quot;&gt;host&lt;/a&gt; within the subnet must send packet to the default gateway in order to communicate to other subnet or the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can enforce policies and rules to restrict some subnet to communicate to other subnet in Router. For example, suppose you want Infrastructure Team subnet to restrict to communicate to Human Resource subnet you can do in your Router. So Router is a Single point of administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/lg2JEKe.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this diagram, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ken&lt;/code&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Jim&lt;/code&gt; can communicate to each other since they are in same subnet. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ken&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Jim&lt;/code&gt; are also called as &lt;a href=&quot;#host&quot;&gt;host&lt;/a&gt;. However, If &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ken&lt;/code&gt; in left side subnet wants to send some data to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ora&lt;/code&gt; who is in right side subnet. Then Ken has to go through his default gateway which is the router. Router defines the default gateway for Ken and Jim is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;192.0.2.1&lt;/code&gt;. Similarly for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ora&lt;/code&gt;, the default gateway is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;198.51.100.1&lt;/code&gt;. So the packet will go from Ken to default Gateway then it will flow to the Ora device via her default gateway. Therefore, all communication across the subnet is happening via the router. Which is also connect to the Internet with the public facing IP address &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;203.0.113.42&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some time Router also has its own default gateway see below diagram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kvpwGXO.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISP (Internet Service Provider) or Data Center has big router with lots of cable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;host&quot;&gt;Host&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Host is a device with specified IP address within the network. It could be your smart phone with IP (192.0.2.104). Or your family member’s iPad or laptop with unique IP address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;subnet-mask&quot;&gt;Subnet Mask&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every device has an IP address with two pieces: the client or host address and the server or network address. IP addresses are either configured by a DHCP server or manually configured (static IP addresses). The subnet mask splits the IP address into the host and network addresses, thereby defining which part of the IP address belongs to the device and which part belongs to the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ip-address-and-subnet-mask&quot;&gt;IP Address and Subnet Mask&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 32-bit IP address uniquely identifies a single device on an IP network. The 32 binary bits are divided into the host and network sections by the subnet mask but they are also broken into four 8-bit octets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ip-address-classes-and-subnet-mask&quot;&gt;IP Address Classes and Subnet Mask&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Class A, B, and C networks have natural masks, or default subnet masks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Class A: 255.0.0.0&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Class B: 255.255.0.0&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Class C: 255.255.255.0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can determine the number and type of IP addresses any given local network requires based on its default subnet mask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-ip-mask&quot;&gt;What is IP Mask?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might use “IP/Mask” as a shorthand to define both the IP address and sub mask at once. In this situation, the IP address is followed by the number of bits in the mask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.0.1.1/24&lt;/strong&gt; equivalent to IP address: 10.0.1.1 with subnet mask of 255.255.255.0.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;216.202.192.66/22&lt;/strong&gt; equivalent to IP address: 216.202.196.66 with a subnet mask of 255.255.252.0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When I was learning Azure Infrastructure, I had big question in my mind what is subnet and why do I need Subnet in my network? If you share my question then here is the article for you! Everything you must know about subnet as a beginner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-subnetting&quot;&gt;What is Subnetting?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sub + Network&lt;/strong&gt; = &lt;strong&gt;Subnet&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You company has one Network that runs your company. You want to break the Network in to small pieces called as Sub Network which is Subnet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kPADsyV.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;align-left&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You buy whole one pizza. However, you eat them in slices, so it is easier to you eat. So you divide you pizza into slices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have one whole network you divide them in smaller network. So that you can manage them easily and organize them better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-we-need-to-subnet-a-network&quot;&gt;Why do we need to Subnet a Network?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 3 main reasons, why you want to subnet a network:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Security 👮&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Organization 🏛️&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Performance 🏃&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-security&quot;&gt;👮 Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have secure, high confidential data in network that you don’t want them to be shared to anyone. It could be your top secrete company project. Your company employees personal records etc. Therefore, your network security is very important. And Subnetting to your network brings security to your Network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;️-organization&quot;&gt;🏛️ Organization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can take each subnet and assign to different department of your company. For example, you distribute your subnet among IT department, HR department, Sales team etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-performance&quot;&gt;🏃 Performance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Subnet is small therefore, it give better performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we connect multiple subnets to each other? Answer is via &lt;a href=&quot;#router&quot;&gt;router&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;router&quot;&gt;Router&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/EkPubq2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A router is a network device that connects different networks together. Each network is signified by it’s network id or area code. You can use router to connect your subnets as well.&lt;mark&gt; Each subnet want to communicate to other subnet must go through the Router. &lt;/mark&gt;. Router acts as a gateway and it has default gateway number for each subnet. So each &lt;a href=&quot;#host&quot;&gt;host&lt;/a&gt; within the subnet must send packet to the default gateway in order to communicate to other subnet or the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can enforce policies and rules to restrict some subnet to communicate to other subnet in Router. For example, suppose you want Infrastructure Team subnet to restrict to communicate to Human Resource subnet you can do in your Router. So Router is a Single point of administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/lg2JEKe.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this diagram, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ken&lt;/code&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Jim&lt;/code&gt; can communicate to each other since they are in same subnet. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ken&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Jim&lt;/code&gt; are also called as &lt;a href=&quot;#host&quot;&gt;host&lt;/a&gt;. However, If &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ken&lt;/code&gt; in left side subnet wants to send some data to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ora&lt;/code&gt; who is in right side subnet. Then Ken has to go through his default gateway which is the router. Router defines the default gateway for Ken and Jim is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;192.0.2.1&lt;/code&gt;. Similarly for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ora&lt;/code&gt;, the default gateway is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;198.51.100.1&lt;/code&gt;. So the packet will go from Ken to default Gateway then it will flow to the Ora device via her default gateway. Therefore, all communication across the subnet is happening via the router. Which is also connect to the Internet with the public facing IP address &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;203.0.113.42&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some time Router also has its own default gateway see below diagram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kvpwGXO.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISP (Internet Service Provider) or Data Center has big router with lots of cable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;host&quot;&gt;Host&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Host is a device with specified IP address within the network. It could be your smart phone with IP (192.0.2.104). Or your family member’s iPad or laptop with unique IP address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;references&quot;&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Do you prefer &lt;strong&gt;LINQ queries&lt;/strong&gt;? I do because they provide a single &lt;strong&gt;consistent programming model&lt;/strong&gt; across how they work with objects in application code and how they express &lt;strong&gt;query logic&lt;/strong&gt; running in the &lt;strong&gt;database&lt;/strong&gt;. In this article I will teach you how can you make &lt;strong&gt;LINQ queries&lt;/strong&gt; as well as &lt;strong&gt;SQL queries&lt;/strong&gt; to fetch documents from &lt;strong&gt;Cosmos DB&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pre-requisite&quot;&gt;Pre-requisite&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have not yet setup your &lt;strong&gt;azure development environment&lt;/strong&gt; then please read my below articles to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-linq-work-in-cosmos-db&quot;&gt;How LINQ work in Cosmos DB&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LINQ&lt;/strong&gt; is a .Net Programming model that gives us an &lt;strong&gt;abstraction&lt;/strong&gt; over querying data. Either you query XML or File or Object you always write a same program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can create an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IQueryable&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; object that directly queries &lt;strong&gt;Azure Cosmos DB&lt;/strong&gt;, which translates the &lt;strong&gt;LINQ query&lt;/strong&gt; into an &lt;strong&gt;Azure Cosmos DB&lt;/strong&gt; query. The query is then passed to the Azure Cosmos DB server to retrieve a set of results in JSON format. The returned results are &lt;strong&gt;de-serialized into a stream of .NET objects&lt;/strong&gt; on the client side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;executing-linq-on-cosmos-db&quot;&gt;Executing LINQ on Cosmos DB&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we will fetch the user by their last name. This time I will write LINQ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/5XcsfJY.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-createdocumentquery-method&quot;&gt;Using CreateDocumentQuery Method&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CreateDocumentQuery&lt;/code&gt; will help us to run LINQ on cosmos DB. While querying we will enable the cross partition query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-csharp highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ExecuteLinqQuery&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;databaseName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;collectionName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Set some common query options&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;FeedOptions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;queryOptions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;FeedOptions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;MaxItemCount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;EnableCrossPartitionQuery&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may surprise that Cosmos DB also support running SQL querries to search an item.
Let’s write code to select user by last name using SQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets call &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ExecuteSQLQuery&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;InitializeDB&lt;/strong&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;DocumentClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Uri&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ConfigurationManager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AppSettings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;accountEndpoint&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ConfigurationManager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AppSettings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;accountKey&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ExecuteSQLQuery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;customers&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;users&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dotnet run&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice the output by running SQL query only. The console displays the output of the SQL queries.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Are you wondering how your function app authenticate &amp;amp; authorize to read or write to Azure SQL table? Do you think how your web application will get programmatically permission to write to storage queue? How would you mange the secrets and credentials used by resourced in your Azure cloud? Are you tired managing credentials? Well in this article, I will explain everything about designing your Azure enterprise resources. Such that all of the applications &amp;amp; azure resources authenticate using credentials and other secretes. And they can communicate to each other seamlessly without you to do any extra work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-do-below-with-passwords&quot;&gt;Don’t Do below with passwords&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hard code in source code&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Place in config file&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use environment variables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;do-below-to-authenticate&quot;&gt;Do below to authenticate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Resource-based authentication&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use Azure Key Vault to store secretes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;manually-managing-identities&quot;&gt;Manually Managing Identities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You create Service Principle in Azure AD&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your application authenticate using certificate, secrete or password&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your Resources under process has to store the certificate, secrete or password&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this is also not advisable. Let’s explore what else you can do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-the-options-for-managing-identities-for-applications&quot;&gt;What are the options for managing identities for applications?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;option-1-using-azure-managed-identity-as-role-based-access-control-rbac&quot;&gt;Option 1: Using Azure Managed Identity as Role Based Access Control (RBAC)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure has many resources that supports &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Role Based Access Controls (RBAC)&lt;/code&gt; like: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Key Vault&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Storage Accounts&lt;/code&gt;. Azure also has resources that supports &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Managed Identity&lt;/code&gt; like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Function App&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Virtual Machines&lt;/code&gt;.
Therefore, you can enable managed identity for a desired application. And go to the desired target resource which you want to access from application and assign role for that application managed identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, enable managed identity Function App. Next you can create Key Vault with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Azure Role Based Access Control&lt;/code&gt; permission model. In the key vault, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Access control (IAM)&lt;/code&gt;, assign Role to this function app for GET, SET etc. permissions. With this setup your Function App can read and write secretes to your newly created Key Vault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--warning&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-exclamation-triangle&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Warning&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not every resources in Azure supports Role Based Access Control. So this above solution may not work for all resources in Azure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;option-2-using-azure-key-vault-to-store-secretes-and-certificates&quot;&gt;Option 2: Using Azure Key Vault to store Secretes and Certificates&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said, not all resources in Azure supports RBAC Managed Identity authentication &amp;amp; authorization. Since these resources don’t support Azure AD. For those resources you must need a secrete or certificates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose you have an application to encrypt a file and you need a secrete to encrypt. Where do you store the secrete? How you application read the secrete at run time? Well the answer for all these questions is &lt;strong&gt;Key Vault&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Key Vault supports Azure AD authentication. It can easily connect with resources with their Managed Identities as RBAC. I can also integrate Key Vault with Azure Policies and adhere to compliances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, you can grant permission to a Function App with their Managed Identity. Now your function app can read the secrete and do the business like encrypt a file etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-azure-managed-identities&quot;&gt;Using Azure Managed Identities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managed identities provide an &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;identity&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;applications&lt;/code&gt; to use when &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;connecting&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;resources&lt;/code&gt; that support &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication&lt;/code&gt;. Applications may use the managed identity to obtain Azure AD tokens from a special Azure endpoint &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://169.254.169.254/metadata/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--success&quot;&gt;🏆 &lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Only resources that support &lt;strong&gt;Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; has a authorization form can allow to connect themselves to other resources using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Managed Identities&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, an application may use a managed identity to access resources like &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview&quot;&gt;Azure Key Vault&lt;/a&gt; where developers can store credentials in a secure manner. You can request different token for Azure Storage Accounts. Or you can read secrete from Azure Key Vault and access to Azure blob storage if you have read permission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Managed Identities is &lt;strong&gt;free of cost&lt;/strong&gt; 💰 no additional charges to use. Microsoft will create a &lt;strong&gt;Security Principle in Azure AD&lt;/strong&gt; when you create Managed Identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/6kH5Py7.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two types of managed Identities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-system-assigned-identity&quot;&gt;1. System-Assigned Identity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;System-Assigned Identity is &lt;strong&gt;one-to-one&lt;/strong&gt; relationship between identity and resource. When you enable a system-assigned managed identity an identity is created in Azure AD that is tied to the &lt;strong&gt;lifecycle&lt;/strong&gt; of that service instance. So when the resource is deleted, Azure automatically deletes the identity for you. For example, an application that runs on a single virtual machine. You can not use or share system-assigned identity with different resources than it created. You can always create the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--success&quot;&gt;🏆 &lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When you have VM you give &lt;strong&gt;system-assigned&lt;/strong&gt; when you delete the VM your identity from Azure AD gets deleted. It &lt;strong&gt;shares the lifecycle of the resource&lt;/strong&gt;. You &lt;strong&gt;can not share&lt;/strong&gt; identity with different resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-user-assigned-identity&quot;&gt;2. User-assigned Identity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User-assigned is &lt;strong&gt;one-to-many&lt;/strong&gt; relationship between identity and resources. It has standalone its own lifecycle. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-manage-ua-identity-portal&quot;&gt;create a user-assigned managed identity&lt;/a&gt; and assign it to one or more instances of an Azure service. For example, a workload where multiple virtual machines need to access the same resource&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--success&quot;&gt;🏆 &lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When you create &lt;strong&gt;user-assigned identity&lt;/strong&gt; then you can use them in many Function Apps, many Virtual Machines, and as many resources as you want. It is &lt;strong&gt;sharable&lt;/strong&gt; identity across resources.
If you delete the resource then user-assigned identity never deletes automatically. You must manually delete them explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you create Managed Identity behind the scene Microsoft will create a security principle in Azure AD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/Tq8p5sH.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/9U5ay1w.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you go to Function App or any resource then you will have &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Identity&lt;/code&gt; under &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Settings&lt;/code&gt; section. There you have choice to either assign System-Assigned Managed Identity or User-Assigned Managed Identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/W6ULtIM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;demo-managed-identity-with-vm&quot;&gt;Demo: Managed Identity with VM&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have System-Managed Identity to my VM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/3aj0sm0.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I can go to Storage Account, Access Control (IAM) and select Role Assignments. I already added VM to Storage Blob data as contributer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/lBTXv3J.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;copying-images-using-vm-system-managed-identity&quot;&gt;Copying Images using VM System Managed Identity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with this VM Identity, I can access any container of this Blob Storage Account. Like using Powershell script I can copy images from blob storage to my VM directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/5DzxE66.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reading-secretes-from-keyvault-using-azure-token-from-vm&quot;&gt;Reading Secretes from KeyVault using Azure Token from VM&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can get Azure Token from special endpoint Azure REST API. Next using token as managed identity I can integrate with Key Vault and read the secretes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you read the key vault secrete from VM. You must go to Key Vault and assign VM managed identity to give access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/PgT8Qrc.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Settings group Access Policies and confirm the VM has permissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/PO3S3TL.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next I can read the secrets from my key vault by making REST API call to key vault and passing &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Authorization=&quot;Bearer $AzureToken&quot;&lt;/code&gt; as request header.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;manually-managing-identities&quot;&gt;Manually Managing Identities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You create Service Principle in Azure AD&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your application authenticate using certificate, secrete or password&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your Resources under process has to store the certificate, secrete or password&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this is also not advisable. Let’s explore what else you can do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-the-options-for-managing-identities-for-applications&quot;&gt;What are the options for managing identities for applications?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;option-1-using-azure-managed-identity-as-role-based-access-control-rbac&quot;&gt;Option 1: Using Azure Managed Identity as Role Based Access Control (RBAC)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure has many resources that supports &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Role Based Access Controls (RBAC)&lt;/code&gt; like: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Key Vault&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Storage Accounts&lt;/code&gt;. Azure also has resources that supports &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Managed Identity&lt;/code&gt; like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Function App&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Virtual Machines&lt;/code&gt;.
Therefore, you can enable managed identity for a desired application. And go to the desired target resource which you want to access from application and assign role for that application managed identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, enable managed identity Function App. Next you can create Key Vault with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Azure Role Based Access Control&lt;/code&gt; permission model. In the key vault, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Access control (IAM)&lt;/code&gt;, assign Role to this function app for GET, SET etc. permissions. With this setup your Function App can read and write secretes to your newly created Key Vault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--warning&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-exclamation-triangle&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Warning&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not every resources in Azure supports Role Based Access Control. So this above solution may not work for all resources in Azure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;option-2-using-azure-key-vault-to-store-secretes-and-certificates&quot;&gt;Option 2: Using Azure Key Vault to store Secretes and Certificates&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said, not all resources in Azure supports RBAC Managed Identity authentication &amp;amp; authorization. Since these resources don’t support Azure AD. For those resources you must need a secrete or certificates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose you have an application to encrypt a file and you need a secrete to encrypt. Where do you store the secrete? How you application read the secrete at run time? Well the answer for all these questions is &lt;strong&gt;Key Vault&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Key Vault supports Azure AD authentication. It can easily connect with resources with their Managed Identities as RBAC. I can also integrate Key Vault with Azure Policies and adhere to compliances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, you can grant permission to a Function App with their Managed Identity. Now your function app can read the secrete and do the business like encrypt a file etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-azure-managed-identities&quot;&gt;Using Azure Managed Identities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managed identities provide an &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;identity&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;applications&lt;/code&gt; to use when &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;connecting&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;resources&lt;/code&gt; that support &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication&lt;/code&gt;. Applications may use the managed identity to obtain Azure AD tokens from a special Azure endpoint &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://169.254.169.254/metadata/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--success&quot;&gt;🏆 &lt;strong&gt;ProTip&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Only resources that support &lt;strong&gt;Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; has a authorization form can allow to connect themselves to other resources using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Managed Identities&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, an application may use a managed identity to access resources like &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview&quot;&gt;Azure Key Vault&lt;/a&gt; where developers can store credentials in a secure manner. You can request different token for Azure Storage Accounts. Or you can read secrete from Azure Key Vault and access to Azure blob storage if you have read permission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--success&quot;&gt;🏆 &lt;strong&gt;ProTip&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Managed Identities is &lt;strong&gt;free of cost&lt;/strong&gt; 💰 no additional charges to use. Microsoft will create a &lt;strong&gt;Security Principle in Azure AD&lt;/strong&gt; when you create Managed Identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-user-assigned-identity&quot;&gt;2. User-assigned Identity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User-assigned is &lt;strong&gt;one-to-many&lt;/strong&gt; relationship between identity and resources. It has standalone its own lifecycle. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-manage-ua-identity-portal&quot;&gt;create a user-assigned managed identity&lt;/a&gt; and assign it to one or more instances of an Azure service.

&lt;p&gt;Next I can read the secrets from my key vault by making REST API call to key vault and passing &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Authorization=&quot;Bearer $AzureToken&quot;&lt;/code&gt; as request header.&lt;/p&gt;

Do you think how your web application will get programmatically permission to write to storage queue? How would you mange the secrets and credentials used by resourced in your Azure cloud? Are you tired managing credentials? Well in this article, I will explain everything about designing your Azure enterprise resources. Such that all of the applications &amp;amp; azure resources authenticate using credentials and other secretes.

  &lt;p&gt;Do you want to create &lt;strong&gt;dotnet csharp console app&lt;/strong&gt; and write &lt;strong&gt;CRUD ( Create, Read, Update and Delete ) operations&lt;/strong&gt; over &lt;strong&gt;Azure Cosmos DB&lt;/strong&gt; noSQL data? Read this article to start from scratch and learn hands on coding on cosmos DB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have not yet setup your &lt;strong&gt;azure development environment&lt;/strong&gt; then please read my below articles to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rupeshtiwari.com/azure-sandbox-free-account-for-learning/&quot;&gt;Get Free Sandbox Azure account for learning Azure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-documents-in-cosmos-db&quot;&gt;Creating Documents in Cosmos DB&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we will create documents in our cosmos DB using dotnet core SDK.
We will use &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.documents.client.documentclient?view=azure-dotnet&quot;&gt;DocumentClient Class&lt;/a&gt; to create document using &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.documents.client.documentclient.createdocumentasync?view=azure-dotnet&quot;&gt;CreateDocumentAsync&lt;/a&gt; method. We will read the document from Cosmos DB using &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.documents.client.documentclient.readdocumentasync?view=azure-dotnet&quot;&gt;ReadDocumentAsync&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defining-csharp-models&quot;&gt;Defining CSharp Models&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets create models that we want to create in the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create below classes in your models folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/6OXpnVN.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-csharp highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;azure_cosmos_db_example&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;creating-document-if-not-exist&quot;&gt;Creating Document if Not Exist&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next let’s create these documents in cosmos db.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we will check if document doesn’t exist then throw exception. And in the catch method we will create new document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add below code in &lt;strong&gt;program.cs&lt;/strong&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-csharp highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Task&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;CreateUserDocumentIfNotExists&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;databaseName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;collectionName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;seeding-data-during-db-initialize&quot;&gt;Seeding Data during DB initialize&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we will create some User data that we will seed during DB initialize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-csharp highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Task&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;InitializeDB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;DocumentClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Uri&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ConfigurationManager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AppSettings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;accountEndpoint&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ConfigurationManager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AppSettings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;accountKey&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;CreateDatabaseIfNotExistsAsync&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Database&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;customers&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;CreateDocumentCollectionIfNotExistsAsync&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;UriFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;CreateDatabaseUri&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;customers&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;DocumentCollection&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;users&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PartitionKey&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;PartitionKeyDefinition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Paths&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Collections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ObjectModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;/userId&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;WriteLine&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Database and collection creation/validation is complete&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;👇&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Creating Document //&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;CreateUserDocumentIfNotExists&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;customers&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;users&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;UserData&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nelapin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;CreateUserDocumentIfNotExists&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;customers&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;users&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;UserData&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;yanhe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;running-program-to-create-documents&quot;&gt;Running Program to Create Documents&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next run your project &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dotnet run&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/DrWfShT.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice our user documents are created already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/heKXWOr.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rupeshtiwari/dotnet-azure-cosmos-db-example/commit/401020da2941750a01de94c8d49673cbd9ff9f32&quot;&gt;Get the Source Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reading-collections-from-cosmos-db&quot;&gt;Reading Collections from Cosmos DB&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this time we have created documents in the &lt;strong&gt;Cosmos DB&lt;/strong&gt;. This is the time to read those documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reading-user-document&quot;&gt;Reading User Document&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next I will show how can you read the document from Cosmos DB. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rupeshtiwari/dotnet-azure-cosmos-db-example/commit/fa6fae9a658290fe3823a83e4c67dd516d5c47ab&quot;&gt;Source Code&lt;/a&gt;. We will use &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.documents.client.documentclient.readdocumentasync?view=azure-dotnet&quot;&gt;ReadDocumentAsync&lt;/a&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-csharp highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;userResource&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;👉&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ReadDocumentAsync&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;UriFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;CreateDocumentUri&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;databaseName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;collectionName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;RequestOptions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PartitionKey&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;PartitionKey&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;UserId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/jeuaawG.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-readdocumentasync-method&quot;&gt;Use ReadDocumentAsync Method&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In below code I will wait till I get the resource from Cosmos DB after making &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ReadDocumentAsync&lt;/code&gt; method call. Next I will read the document and display on console after serializing it in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;json&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-csharp highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dotnet run&lt;/code&gt; to see the output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;update-documents-in-cosmos-db&quot;&gt;Update Documents in Cosmos DB&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure Cosmos DB supports &lt;strong&gt;replacing JSON documents&lt;/strong&gt;. The fun part is even you can update the document right from the Visual Studio Code. Let’s replace user’s last name from dotnet core app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/gyXhCWg.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will use &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.documents.client.documentclient.replacedocumentasync?view=azure-dotnet&quot;&gt;ReplaceDocumentAsync&lt;/a&gt; method to update the existing document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-replacedocumentasync-method&quot;&gt;Use ReplaceDocumentAsync method&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s write code to replace a user document using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ReplaceDocumentAsync&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-csharp highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Task&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;ReplaceUserDocument&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;databaseName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;collectionName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;updatedUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Did you know you can create and deploy Azure resources using JSON template? Did you also know that you can enforce business compliances on your resources? All of this can be done using Azure Resource Manager (ARM). Read this article to learn everything important about ARM. You can write code to deploy infrastructure using ARM template called Infrastructure-as-Code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-arm&quot;&gt;What is ARM?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure Resource Manager(ARM) is the deployment and management service for Azure. It provides a management layer that enables you to create, update, and delete resources in your Azure account. You use management features, like access control, locks, and tags, to secure and organize your resources after deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;arm-is-central-api-for-azure-resources&quot;&gt;ARM is central API for Azure resources&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a user sends a request from any of the Azure tools, APIs, or SDKs, Resource Manager receives the request. It authenticates and authorizes the request. Resource Manager sends the request to the Azure service, which takes the requested action. Because all requests are handled through the same API, you see consistent results and capabilities in all the different tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following image shows the role Azure Resource Manager plays in handling Azure requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/H2jU5kP.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--success&quot;&gt;🏆 &lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 ARM new functionality initially released through &lt;strong&gt;APIs&lt;/strong&gt; will be represented in the &lt;strong&gt;portal&lt;/strong&gt; within &lt;strong&gt;180&lt;/strong&gt; days of initial release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-resource-in-azure&quot;&gt;What is Resource in Azure?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A manageable item that is available through Azure. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Virtual machines, storage accounts, web apps, databases, and virtual networks&lt;/code&gt; are examples of resources. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Resource groups, subscriptions, management groups, and tags&lt;/code&gt; are also examples of resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--info&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-info-circle&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What do you mean by Azure Management and when we say Azure manages resources etc.?&lt;/strong&gt;
You use Azure Management Features, like &lt;strong&gt;access control&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;locks&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;tags&lt;/strong&gt;, to secure and organize your resources after deployment. If you create Resource group then you can manage all of the resources that shares the same compliances.
Check my &lt;a href=&quot;https://rupeshtiwari.com/design-azure-governance-for-microsoft-azure-solutions-architect/&quot;&gt;Azure Governance article&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-resource-group-in-azure&quot;&gt;What is Resource Group in Azure?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;container&lt;/code&gt; that holds related &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;resources&lt;/code&gt; for an Azure solution. The resource group includes those resources that you want to manage as a group. You decide which resources belong in a resource group based on what makes the most sense for your organization.
Important factors to put resource in Resource Group:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;group-resources-by-lifecycle&quot;&gt;Group resources by lifecycle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the resources in your resource group should share the same &lt;strong&gt;lifecycle&lt;/strong&gt;. You deploy, update, and delete them together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--info&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-info-circle&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 If one resource, such as a server, needs to exist on a different deployment cycle it should be in another resource group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;resource-can-exist-in-only-one-group&quot;&gt;Resource can exist in only one group.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each resource can exist in only one resource group. Same resource instance can not belong to multiple resource groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;resource-locations-can-be-different&quot;&gt;Resource locations can be different&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the resources in a resource group can be located in different regions than the resource group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;resource-can-change-groups&quot;&gt;Resource can change groups&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can move a resource from one resource group to another group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;resource-group-must-have-location&quot;&gt;Resource group must have location&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When creating a resource group, you need to provide a location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--success&quot;&gt;🏆 &lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;“Why does a resource group need a location?”&lt;/strong&gt; And, if the resources can have different locations than the resource group, why does the resource group location matter at all?” The resource group stores metadata about the resources. When you specify a location for the resource group, you’re specifying where that metadata is stored. For compliance reasons, you may need to ensure that your data is stored in a particular region.
See &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview#resource-groups&quot;&gt;Resource groups&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--warning&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-exclamation-triangle&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Warning&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 If the resource group’s region is temporarily unavailable, you can’t update resources in the resource group because the metadata is unavailable. The resources in other regions will still function as expected, but you can’t update them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;resource-group-is-good-boundary-for-security-and-compliances&quot;&gt;Resource group is good boundary for security and compliances&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A resource group can be used to scope access control for administrative actions. To manage a resource group, you can assign &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/overview&quot;&gt;Azure Policies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal&quot;&gt;Azure roles&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/lock-resources&quot;&gt;resource locks&lt;/a&gt;. 7. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/tag-resources&quot;&gt;apply tags&lt;/a&gt; to a resource group. The resources in the resource group don’t inherit those tags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;resource-group-can-be-tagged&quot;&gt;Resource group can be Tagged&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/tag-resources&quot;&gt;apply tags&lt;/a&gt; to a resource group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--info&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-info-circle&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 The resources in the resource group don’t inherit those tags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;resources-can-communication-across-groups&quot;&gt;Resources can communication across groups&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A resource can connect to resources in other resource groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--success&quot;&gt;🏆 &lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 You can have a web app that connects to a database in a different resource group. These two resources are related but don’t share the same lifecycle however they can connect to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;resource-is-composed-in-group&quot;&gt;Resource is composed in group&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you delete a resource group, all resources in the resource group are also deleted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;800-resources-in-a-group&quot;&gt;800 Resources in a group&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can deploy up to 800 instances of a resource type in each resource group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;resource-can-exist-outside-of-group&quot;&gt;Resource can exist outside of group&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some resources can exist outside of a resource group. These resources are deployed to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-to-subscription&quot;&gt;subscription&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-to-management-group&quot;&gt;management group&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-to-tenant&quot;&gt;tenant&lt;/a&gt;. Only specific resource types are supported at these scopes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;notice--success&quot;&gt;🏆 &lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;View themes in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/tree/main/themes&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some top listed Nerd Fonts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/ZfjdTEu.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;setting-a-theme&quot;&gt;Setting a Theme&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run on admin PowerShell to setup &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;agnoster&lt;/code&gt; theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-powershell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Set-PoshPrompt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-Theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;agnoster&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can setup custom theme as well &lt;a href=&quot;https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/upgrading/#i-use-a-custom-themesettings&quot;&gt;learn more&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/KFzr46S.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can see colors are coming 😃 However, we have to fix the fonts I will explain next that. For Now lets make this colors as our default in PowerShell. Follow me in next steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;-make-powershell-theme-permanent&quot;&gt;💯 Make PowerShell Theme Permanent&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice, once you close this PowerShell and open new then colors will go away. In order to make this permanent you must update the profile of PowerShell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;check-profile-exists&quot;&gt;Check Profile Exists&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the time we don’t have any profile&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;test-path $profile&lt;/code&gt; if this returns &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;False&lt;/code&gt; then you must create new one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/elXcEim.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;create-new-powershell-profile&quot;&gt;Create new PowerShell Profile&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-powershell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;New-Item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$profile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;force&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/uKmrLSm.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice new profile file created it is empty now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/MzCHIRy.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;setting-default-powershell-colors&quot;&gt;Setting Default PowerShell Colors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now open PowerShell profile file and paste below code to setup default colors. Save and close the file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-powershell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Import-Module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;posh-git&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Import-Module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;oh-my-posh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Set-PoshPrompt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-Theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Paradox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Close and reopen PowerShell terminal to see the effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;-fixing-fonts&quot;&gt;🆎 Fixing Fonts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice our PowerShell shows lots of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; because we are missing required fonts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/KFzr46S.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets fix them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;which-fonts-i-need&quot;&gt;Which Fonts I need?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oh my Posh&lt;/strong&gt; was designed to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nerdfonts.com/&quot;&gt;Nerd Fonts&lt;/a&gt;. Nerd Fonts are popular fonts that are patched to include icons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;download-nerd-fonts&quot;&gt;Download Nerd Fonts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On windows machine go to the link and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads&quot;&gt;download&lt;/a&gt; your favorite fonts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Right click on the specific font face &amp;amp; “Install for all users”. Check the GIF for clarification where I’m using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;3270 Nerd Font&lt;/code&gt; face.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/rlgfSrf.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;set-powershell-fonts&quot;&gt;Set PowerShell Fonts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open PowerShell&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Right Click Properties next go to font Tab.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Search for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;3270Medium Nerd Font&lt;/code&gt; and select ok.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now open new PowerShell Terminal and enjoy your brand new colorful theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/1j53eJU.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/26La18u.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;changing-powershell-theme&quot;&gt;🥇Changing PowerShell Theme&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;select-new-theme&quot;&gt;Select New Theme&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First browse all themes and select yours one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/lOQIM6c.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to select &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jandedobbeleer&lt;/code&gt; theme this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgur.com/4GMa0mw.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;set-new-theme-as-default&quot;&gt;Set new Theme As Default&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now open the PowerShell profile and update the theme name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-powershell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Import-Module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;posh-git&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Import-Module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;oh-my-posh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Set-PoshPrompt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-Theme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;jandedobbeleer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open user settings in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;json&lt;/code&gt; and paste below code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Fira Code&lt;/code&gt; then change the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fontFamily&lt;/code&gt; accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
