				Think of Self Development in your life, <span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-development is so important.</span> Abdul Kalam used to say know the truth and it will make you free. Knowledge is power hence work towards gaining more knowledge on your subject field. Your personalty get affected by many things however these 2 things are more important.</p>
<ul>
<li>People you mix in with and</li>
<li>Books you read.</li>
</ul>
<h3>People you mix with</h3>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ecstatic-group-enjoying-the-party-picture-id643137108?b=1&amp;k=6&amp;m=643137108&amp;s=612x612&amp;w=0&amp;h=J-ZiDngoIe06PGOXW5wa3obxkGYVlqjAWpnz8elBSqM=" alt="Ecstatic group enjoying the party" /></p>
<p>People and friends have great impact on your life. Example, if you regularly mix with people who are depressed, hopeless and negative mentality then you can never set your goal positive. Those kind of people will have effect in your life which will drag you towards ruination. If you mix with people who are optimistic and courageous then you will also be always positive and can set more challenging goals in your life.</p>
<p>Example when I was on school, I used to go ground for running and normally I and my friend both used to run just one round then sit and do yoga. But I had one more friend who used to make 10 - 15 round daily. One day I spoke with him and asked can I run with him. When I started running with him to my surprise I could run 10 rounds within 20 days. It was great achievement though I never liked running and neither I am an Athlete.</p>
<h3>Books you read</h3>

<p>Books are best friends they don't complain and never hurts you. Try to read a book every month. When I was software developer 9 years back jQuery was very famous and I wanted to be expert on it. So I started searching materials on it, in YouTube, articles etc and got some knowledge. However when I started reading "<a href="https://www.manning.com/books/jquery-in-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jQuery in Action</a>" book, I became expert on jQuery and I wrote my own<a href="https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/260362/Learning-jQuery-using-jQuery-Lab" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> jQuery Article at Code Project.come</a> also I trained couple of teams in my company on jQuery. Reading jQuery book was not easy task for me. The book was big what I did is I printed out the chapter one which was around 30 pages. Then I keep that in my bag and I used to read that 30 pages I imagine that as a small book and try to finish it within 3 or 4 days. Next I printed out 2nd chapter and so on.</p>
<h2>Your Skill should be of T shape</h2>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/letter-t-in-cement-1-1258628.jpg" alt="Letter T in cement 1" /></p>
<blockquote><p>Be <strong>T</strong> shaped in your skills. Horizontal line in T shape defines that you have multiple skills. The vertical line defines one skill that is your strength and you are good at it. You should be trying to be like T shape.</p></blockquote>
<p>Like I know both server side programming and client side. I am good at both server and client however I want to be expert on React, Angular, Typescript, NodeJS etc. Although I am full stack but I am expert on client side work. That makes me more strong at least at one area. Go on every training course that you can go. Every seminars that you can attain please attain them so that you have good knowledge around your subject area.</p>
