<p>Hierarchical Injection</p>
<p>Any service can be injected at app module level or at child module level or component level or at element level.</p>
<h2>App level Dependency</h2>
<p>Do You want to have single instance of certain class throught your app ? If answer is Yes then below example is helpful for you.</p>
<p>Example if you have a e-store app you want single calculator throughout your app then you create Calculator and provide this at app module level. Then in the estore app, sales and pricing both child modules will get a single shared instance of Calculator.</p>
<p>Calculator has function getCurrentResult will give same result in both sales and pricing module.</p>
<h2>Module Level Dependency</h2>
