				how can i use a regular js file like calculator in node js project ?</p>
<p>What if you have any JavaScript library which you want to use in angular app or any Webpack enabled app ? If yes the. Please read this article.</p>
<p>Now a days writing typescript app with Webpack is common. The environment is nodejs. I mean the app runs locally with nodejs packages such as Webpack Dev server etc. Even angular app generated by angular cli runs with Webpack. Therefore, it is important to know how can we consume any third party JavaScript library and consume it in our app.</p>
<p>Let's take an example suppose you have calculator.js file which you got from online. It is simple JavaScript file with one global object called as calculator. Now imagine you want to consume it in Angular App or regular Typescript App with Webpack.</p>
<p>Let's Integrate first in Angular App.		</p>
