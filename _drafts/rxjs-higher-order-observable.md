> Learn what is RxJS higher order observables and their mapping operators such as switch map, exhaust map etc. Work on an Angular project at the end and do exercises with me to learn how to apply higher order operators in given problems.

## RxJS Higher Order Course Introduction

In this course, I will be teaching you What is first order observables and How do we map first order observables in brief. Next I will teach you what is Higher order Observables, why do you need higher order observables? And Without knowing Inner and Outer Observables you can not understand the Higher order observables concept. So You will learn about Inner and Outer Observables also.Next You will learn Higher order observable Mappings to understand how in RxJS you can handle  higher order observables. Which will concrete your understanding on Higher order observables mapping.

## Learn RxJS with Real world Examples

I will explain the concepts by giving real world problems and we will solve those problems together so that you can become an expert on Higher order observables. Theoretical knowledge with some coding experience will not make you a perfect software engineer. Unless you really work on a real world project. Therefore, In our last section, I will show you one working angular application. Where we have some problems related to higher order observables and we will work together on that project to fix those problems with the knowledge that you gained from this project. We will do hands-on coding on that sample application so be prepared. I will guide you and so that you will learn when , where and why to use which kind of higher-order observable mapping operator. By the end of this course you will be an expert on Higher order observables and you will be ready to work on any challenging assignments on Reactive Angular, NgRx, Observable Redux or any RxJS kind of application. 

## Course Prerequisite

In order to get most out of this course. I will recommend, to have some basic knowledge on RxJS observables and RxJS basic operators. You do not need expertise on them, just basic understanding is enough to start with this course. Also, Feel free to watch my Free RxJS courses for beginners and advanced level in Fullstack Master.
