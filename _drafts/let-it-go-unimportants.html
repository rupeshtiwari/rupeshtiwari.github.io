<blockquote><p>If you want to achieve more and have better life then reduce the wasted time.</p>
<p>if you want to have more fun then reduce the things that you don't enjoy.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are 2 options for that</p>
<p>First option is <strong>Say No and have a No Crap Policy (NCP)</strong></p>
<p>Working long hours go home and fix those broken work and no time for family. You should decide and say no to these things.</p>
<p>If you say no to daily one hour extra work then you save 5 hours a week that you can use for your personal development.</p>
<p>If it makes someone happy and big difference in their life and you are not affected by saying yes then please consider saying yes at that time.</p>
<p>second option is <strong>Partial No or Negotiate</strong></p>
<p>It is much better option for work because there you cant always say No. You can negotiate your client to come to your office rather you go to them will save your time. You could negotiate your office meetings and ask them to join second half of the meeting if first half is not important for you and they can continue without you that will save your one hour per week and 50 hours per year.</p>
<p>If your relative asks you to visit you to their home. You should not use first option and say No rather you could say Yes however negotiate and instead of going saturday morning you could ask them that you can come afternoon time and you all can go to shopping and have outside dinner. This way you will save your morning time and you can do something for yourself.		</p>
