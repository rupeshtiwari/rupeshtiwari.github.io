## Precompiled Azure Functions Basics

> Are you still using **.csx** scripts for your Azure Functions? Then switch to **Precompiled Azure Function.** Read this article to learn from scratch about writing, testing and deploying Precompiled Azure Functions.

### Why Azure Functions?

1. **Event Driven** architecture & follows Single Responsibility Principle.
2. **Fully managed** compute environment
3. High **reliability**
4. **Security** is taken care by Microsoft
5. **Auto-Scaling** for large or low incoming volumes
6. **Pay-per-use** ( use consumption pricing plan )
7. Less **boilerplate** code
8. **Integrate easily** with many Azure Cloud Services

### Benefits Precompiled Azure Functions

1. Normal **c# classes** but precompiled. ( it used to be **.csx**)
2. **Precompiled** Azure Functions works with **Visual Studio** so you get all tooling supports like debugging, intellisense, NuGet package manager etc.
3. **Local** Azure Function **runtime environment**. Write, debug and unit test locally.
4. You get excellent **cold-start** performance. In old days `.csx` files are getting compiled when first request hits it. However, with pre-compiled Azure Functions you get this performance benefit.

### Azure Function Overview

![](https://i.imgur.com/t7QZRPA.png)

1. Azure function triggers when one of the event occurs like
   Http request or new blob created.
2. It has input and output bindings. Input binding allows to define additional data. Output bindings allows to connect to storage or other 3rd party service.
3. Azur Function contains the business code.
4. We can combine many Azure Functions and deploy them as one unit which is called as **Azure Function App**. It is a deployment unit.

### Azure Function's Attributes

It is a **C# Attributes** used for:

1. Communicate to **Azure Runtime** like tell the name of the function.
   ```csharp
   [FunctionName("ASBTriggerApp")]
      ðŸ‘†
   /* specify that this function will
   be called as **ASBTriggerQueue
   */
   ```
2. How the function will be triggered.
   ```csharp
   [ServiceBusTrigger("ASBTriggerQueue")]
      ðŸ‘†
   /* Trigger whenever new message
   arrives to Azure Service Bus Queue.
   */
   ```
3. To setup output bindings like bind to Queue, Blob, Tables Service Bus, EventHub

## Development Environment Setup

I will use **Visual Studio** to do below things.

1. Create **New Azure Function app**
2. Create New **Function**
3. Write **Unit Test** for Azure Function
4. **Debug and Compile** Function
5. Publish functions to Azure

### Create Microsoft Account

I will assume you have your Microsoft account. Go to https://azure.microsoft.com/free to get your own azure free account.

### Visual Studio Setup

1. Make sure you have visual studio.
2. Make sure you update your Visual Studio Installer First.

3. Install **Azure Development Workload** from **Visual Studio Installer**.

### Visual Studio Extensions for Azure

Make sure to install **Cloud Explorer** VS Extension.

### Creating New Empty Function App Project.

Select Azure Function Template from Create new project.

### HttpTrigger Event

HttpTrigger has 3 parameters.

#### Authorization Level

How HttpTrigger should be Authorized.

```csharp
public enum AuthorizationLevel
{
    Anonymous,
    /*
    ðŸ‘† Anybody has http URL can call
     this azure function
    */
    User,
    Function,
    /*
    ðŸ‘† Each Http Function must have
    individual Function key. Anyone has to
    pass function key in the URL query
    param or request header.
    */
    System,
    Admin
    /*
    ðŸ‘† Each Http URL must have admin key
    for the entire function app it works for
    all functions.
    */
}
```

#### Http Methods

"get" or "post" or array of methods. If correct method is not invoked it will return 404 error.

#### Route

URL can be changed by using route template.

Example: if `Route="MyFn"` then the URL will be `http://localhost:7071/api/MyFn`.

Dynamic parameter at route using template.

`Route="MyFn/{id}"` Then the URL will be: `http://localhost:7071/api/MyFn/23`

## Creating New Function & Publishing to Azure

Here is the workflow of creating new Azure Functions Project and deploying to Azure.

### Admission Form Approval System Example

We are going to work on college admission form approval system.

You will learn below Triggers

- âœ…Azure Storage
- âœ…Azure Blog
- âœ…Http

Here is the [source-code](https://dev.azure.com/rupesh-opensource/RupeshOpenSource/_git/azure-functions-admission-application)

### Debugging Locally Azure Functions

In **Visual Studio** click on **Run in debug** mode and you would see your app is up and running. Then You can even query your api with URL http://localhost:7071/api/Function1
