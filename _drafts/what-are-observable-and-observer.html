<p>
				Observable is not a data type. Rather it is a behavior over stream of data. Observable is standard, that can be created with any kind of data types.</p>
<p>Imagine there are few shipments scheduled to come to your home but you are not at your home that time. You will ask your community office to receive your shipments and then when they receive any package they will call you so that you can collect the package from them. Your Community Office will call you 4 times and then you will get all of your four shipments.</p>
<p>In this example Community Office is Observable</p>
