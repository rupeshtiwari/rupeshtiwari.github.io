<h2>What is Extreme Programming</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To heal the damage between Business and Developers. Develop the trust for developers in Business. Kent discovered <code>Extreme Programming</code>. A process that creates a massive amount communication and collaboration between developers and business. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>R. C. Martin ( Uncle Bob) &amp; Kent C. they both created a terminology called as <code>XP Immersion </code>  ( Extreme Programming Immersion )</p>

<h2>definition of Scrum Master</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Scrum Master is a coach s/he is not a manager. S/ he is responsible for defending the process. S/He is not meant to defend the project, stories, backlog, schedule, budget etc. The Scrum Master role was meant to be rotating to various team member. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>project manager as Scrum master Now a Days</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Developers was not taking the certification for scrum master it was only project managers they started taking certification and started becoming scrum master. The original concept and idea of <code>Scrum Master</code> was not very much liked by the <code>Project Managers</code> who became scrum master after giving certifications.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>scrum delivery timelines &amp; pressure</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Because of the pressure that scrum team has that every 2 week you have to deliver some thing working regardless how much fast you have to code. How much bad code you have to write. Don't worry write any <code>junk</code> | <code>bad code</code> in order for making your story done. This kind of thinking and work culture is making project at risk. As your project grows then it <code>rots</code>. Every sprint it will get harder and harder to make progress because you project is getting worse &amp; worse &amp; worse day by day. When you go fast you need some disciplines to avoid your code roting over time. </p>

<h2>What is Flaccid Scrum </h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Us vs Them attitude means Developer vs Project Manager attitude. No talks about development technique lots of talk about the Project Management Technique. This divides business and developers.<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kent-Beck/e/B000APC0EY/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1"> Kent Beck </a>vision of agile methodology failed here. Velocity goes down over the time. Developers are working very hard because they want to keep the velocity up and story done. Because Scrum Master is forcing them to go faster and generate pressure over the team. Then if this keep going and increasing then team will fall back to water fall model. </p>

<h2>Scrum team can not go fast</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Your Scrum Team can not go fast</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Without Technical Quality, </li>
<li>Without Removing Technical debts. </li>
<li>Without Good Design</li>
<li>By Avoiding Writing Test</li>
<li>By Rushing </li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p> <strong>If you want to go fast then</strong> <strong>Stay Clean</strong></p>

<h2>What are Technical Practices</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>First you write your Functional Test then you write Unit Test then you write your production code. Functional Tests can be written by <code>Spec Flow</code>. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Manual Testing is Immoral!</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We are asking asking QA people to act like as Machine which is <code>Immoral</code>. The test which a machine/automation can do we are asking QA people to do manually. Sometimes developers not write test and they become army's of QA people by doing Manual Test. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Manual Test will grow over time and it will be a big burden over business. It may go 6 Million Dolor to just do manual test on every release. Huge loss to business and you end up stopping the manual test and spoil your project.</p>

<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Is it a Good Idea to Test your system through UI</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Not a good idea to test the system through UI. We should only test<strong> UI </strong>from the UI. When you are testing the <code>Business Rule</code> you should keep the UI separate. When you are testing UI then you are not testing <code>Business Rules</code>.  </p>
