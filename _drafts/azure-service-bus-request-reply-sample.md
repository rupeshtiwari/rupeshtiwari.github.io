> If you want to send message from UI and get response back to UI in `Azure Service Bus`. Then you must consider learning **Request/Reply** pattern.

You will learn how to integrate `Azure Functions` with `Azure Service Bus Queue`.

## Introduction

Microsoft Azure Service Bus `sessions` enable joint and ordered handling of unbounded sequences of related messages. Sessions can be used in `first in, first out (FIFO) and request-response` patterns. This article shows how to use session to implement Request/Reply patterns when using Service Bus.

## Request/Reply Pattern

`Request/Reply` pattern is also treated as `Producer/Consumer` pattern. If you are working with distributed architecture including cloud. Then it is difficult to do synchronous actions. However, using Request/Reply pattern you can work just like synchronous operation.

Example: Suppose you have UI says create order and once order is created you must show order-id in the UI. We will use Azure Function and Azure Service Bus in order to Achieve this.

You will create `Azure Function-1` to trigger by `Http` request. Then it will send a `message` to the `Queue` and you will write another `Azure Function-2` to get triggered by the Queue & execute the use case. However, once the `Function-2` is done it will `reply back` to the `Function-1`. Finally the result will be returned back to the UI/Client.

Below is the pseudo code for above example:

```csharp
[HttpGet("orders/create")]
public async Task<IActionResult> CreateOrder(Order order) {

  const result = await requestReplyService.Request();

  return Ok(result);
}
```

1. `Request/Reply` is not the same as `Request/Response`. Request/Reply is usually associated with `asynchronous` messages while Request/Response with the `web`.

2. For `Request/Reply` to work, both the sender and the receiver require a designated queue. There is a dedicated handler and receiver for a message Request/Reply.

### Writing to Azure Service Queue

Once we receive payload from client we are going to put the message on service bus Queue.

Next `CreateOrderSender` function must write the payload into Azure Service Queue called `create-order-queue`.

Let's install `Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs` and `Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.ServiceBus` to get `Queue` outbound Attributes.

```shell
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.ServiceBus --version 1.1.2
```

If you're using binding extensions (e.g. Azure Storage, ServiceBus, Timers, etc.) make sure you've called the registration method for the extension(s) in your startup code (e.g. builder.AddAzureStorage(), builder.AddServiceBus(), builder.AddTimers(), etc.).

In order for connecting to Azure Service Bus Queue we need Azure Web Job Service Bus Connection string that you get from Root Manage Shared Access Key from Azure Portal. ![](https://imgur.com/KuTiOQf.png)

Add `AzureWebJobsServiceBus` in `local.settings.json` file.

Also provide Azure Web Job Storage to use Azure Emulator. `"AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",`

```json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet",
    "AzureWebJobsServiceBus": "<replace your RootManageSharedAccessKey here>"
  }
}
```

[Download the Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/) if you want to see the data visually.

In order to get `MessageSender` we must setup startup where we have to register the `MessageSender` so that function will receive in-built `MessageSender` service from Azure.

ConfigurationManager can be found by installing `dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration`
