# In Azure Storage Account

# Feature

Feature is capability of a service. Like **Metrics Explorer** is a feature of **Azure Monitor** Service.

# Service

File, Blob, Queues, Azure Monitor

# Resource

Container  
Service  
Object

# Log Analytics Workspace

Log Analytics Workspace is actually a **Azure Data Lake**.

# VM Scale Set

![](httpss://imgur.com/uGhua33.png)

- VM scale set is an Azure service allows you to run
- It contains multiple VMs with the same image and contents.
- It has instances, which are the VMs.
- You can create more VMs by scaling it up from Azure Portal or Enable auto scale.

## SAN

SAN: [storage area network (SAN) ](httpss://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/azure/migrate/prepare-for-migration#configure-san-policy)
By default, Azure VMs are assigned drive D to use as temporary storage

- This drive assignment causes all other attached storage drive assignments to increment by one letter.
- For example, if your on-premises installation uses a data disk that is assigned to drive D for application installations, the assignment for this drive increments to drive E after you migrate the VM to Azure.
- To prevent this automatic assignment, and to ensure that Azure assigns the next free drive letter to its temporary volume, set the storage area network (SAN) policy to **OnlineAll**:

## ARR

**Application Request Routing (ARR)** is a feature where when a client (or browser) request to any Azure based website, a cookie will be created and stick to the first time request received web site instance.

## PIP

A virtual machine running in Azure can now be associated with a direct and publicly accessible IP address that sticks to the VM for its lifetime.

## NSG

A **network security group (NSG)** contains a list of security rules that allow or deny network traffic to resources connected to Azure Virtual Networks (VNet). NSGs can be associated to subnets or individual network interfaces (NIC) attached to VMs.

## NIC

A [Network Interface (NIC)](httpss://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-network-interface) enables an Azure Virtual Machine to communicate with internet, Azure, and on-premises resources. When creating a virtual machine using the Azure portal, the portal creates one network interface with default settings for you.

## RBAC

**Role-based access control (RBAC)** is a policy-neutral access-control mechanism defined around roles and privileges. The components of RBAC such as role-permissions, user-role and role-role relationships make it simple to perform user assignments.

## CMDB

Configuration Management Database

## Rack

A Rack has servers (Virtual Machines) in a data-center.

## SKU

Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) Learn more about [SKU types in Azure](httpss://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/compute/resourceskus/list)

## VPN

Virtual Private Network (VPN). In Azure VPN is a type of Virtual Network Gateway.

## VIP

Virtual IP address. VIP is an IP address that doesn't correspond to an actual physical network interface.

## BGP

‚ÄúBorder Gateway Protocol (BGP)" is a standardized exterior gateway protocol designed to exchange routing and reachability information between autonomous systems (AS) on the Internet.

## IKE

Internet Key Exchange

## IPSec

Internet Protocol Security (IPSec)

## IPV

Internet Protocol Version (IPV). **IPv6** is more advanced and has better features compared to **IPv4**.

## LNG

The Local Network Gateway (LNG) typically refers to your on-premises location. [Learn...](httpss://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-create-site-to-site-rm-powershell)

## CIDR

Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR).

## NFS

Network File System (NFS)

## SMB

Server Message Block (SMB)

## FQDN

fully qualified domain name

## DMS

Azure Database Migration Service

## UDR

User Defined Routing (UDR)

## DDoS

Distributed denial of service (DDoS) [Learn More](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ddos-protection/ddos-protection-overview)

### Azure Service Health

![](https://imgur.com/Nc5EvmZ.png){: .align--left}

[Azure Status](https://status.azure.com/en-us/status) generates all global Azure service status. Azure Service Health broadly check 4 different kind of health categories like:
[Planned Maintenance](#planned-maintenance), [Health Advisories](#health-advisories), [Security Advisories](#security-advisories), [Service Issues](#service-issues). Azure Health also allows you to configure health alerts based on above categories events. You can also add action groups to either email or SMS or phone call on desired health events.

{: .notice--success}
üèÜ **ProTip** \
\
Azure Service Health is: **Planned, Health & Security, Service**.

<div class="mermaid">

¬†¬†¬†¬†A(Azure Service Health)-->P(Planned Maintenance);
    A-->H(Health Advisories);
    A-->S2(Security Advisories);
¬†¬†¬†¬†A-->S(Service Issues);
</div>

#### Planned Maintenance

You can find planned maintenance in Azure and notify your clients of an up coming events or reschedule an up coming release.

#### Health Advisories

Changes in Azure Service that require your attention. For example, if features in a service that you use are being deprecated or you need to upgrade your web application because a framework version in Azure App Service is updated.

#### Security Advisories

Notifications or violations that may affect availability of your Azure services.

#### Service Issues

In the Azure portal Azure Service Health list down all the service issues that may impact you based on your resources in use.

### Azure Monitor

Azure Monitor is a solution within Azure for collecting and analyzing telemetry from your Azure or on-premises resources.

<div class="mermaid">
graph¬†TD;
¬†¬†¬†¬†A(Azure Monitor)-->M(Metrics);
    A-->L(Logs);
    A-->W(Workbooks);

</div>

### Azure Mobile App

Azure Mobile App gives an easy and secure way to manage your Azure resources, even when you are out of the office and not near computer.
