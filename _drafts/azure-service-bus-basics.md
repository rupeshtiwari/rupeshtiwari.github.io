Event Grid 

Event Hubs

Storage Queues

## Pricing Tiers

Basic, Standard : Consumption (Operation)

Premium : Resource MsgUnit

## Code


## Service Bus Explorer

Azure portal has also service bus explorer. 

## Management

### Send Message

![](https://imgur.com/5eKyS5L.png)

### Receiving from Queue

Receive Message from Entity ( Entity could be topic, Subscription, Queue )

![](https://imgur.com/nnGuH9V.png)

## Service Bus Processor 

AutoCompleteMessage default is true. 

Max Concurrent Calls: Define how much messages you want to handle parallelly.  

Max Auto Lock RenewalDuration
If message takes more than 10 sec then renew. 

ReceiveMode = PeekLock

### Processing Message

### Exception Handling 

![](https://imgur.com/bGS2yO8.png)
![](https://imgur.com/PUFAtfc.png)
The message is retry till max delivery count is reached. Message are tried immediately. If you want to throttle the message retry time then manually write code for that. 

### Start/Stop Processor

## Connections 

SDK connection they allow to send or receive message from Azure Service Bus. 

- Connections
   - Sessions
     - Links 

![](https://imgur.com/ozihscT.png)

SPMP 1000 connections

Create more service bus client 

![](https://imgur.com/XiHvoXq.png)


Receiver 

1 for sender MQTT and one for Receiver. 

![](https://imgur.com/juF5u9w.png)

TCP is bottle neck then create multiple AWS clients


## Scheduling 
> Do not deliver this message before this time. 

Concept of time in our ASB. 

![](https://imgur.com/Tv1ndOw.png)

### Cancel a scheduled message 

![](https://imgur.com/KN2tcKG.png)

Scheduled messages do not count on active messages. 

In example: Only one message received the other one is canceled. 
![](https://imgur.com/TUzwyjZ.png)


## Expiry

Event broadcast in a system that has limited lifetime. Every subscriber has to process them and find out the new messages if the existing one is expired. 

### One Message itself u can define expiry.
Queue will automatically overwrite the expired one.

![](https://imgur.com/PlLZ5qD.png)

Running code:

![](https://imgur.com/66PmFsy.png)

Once it is expired where it goes? 
These meessages will be dissapared they will not be shown on the Service Bus Explorere also. 

### One is on the Entity itself


## Dead Lettering

when max delivery count is reached 
You don't want to loose the payload then u can define `deadlettering`. There is a queue it self is $transfer and it has $transfer_deadlettering queue.

Exploring Messages:

![](https://imgur.com/7j0idrG.png)

## Forwarding 

Allows u to connect together entities act as forward

they do not hold the message 

they just forward

Message go through more than 4 queues or topics then they go to transfer deadlettering

if destination reach to max entity size 

or it reach max entity count it goes to deadlettering queue. 

Service bus bill per operation: 

1 send operation and 4 forwarding 


![](https://imgur.com/4XPqgpQ.png)


![](https://imgur.com/N0VMCV8.png)

forward hop4 to hop0
![](https://imgur.com/dQqGfa8.png)

![](https://imgur.com/6GojW1O.png)


can not receive from entity where forward enabled.
Therefore u can not retrieve message from hop0. 

![](https://imgur.com/hxq7pdP.png)


## Pub/Sub

Not want to use queue and want to get 

decouple the sender from receiver queue 

ASB has topics 

send a message to a topics 

receiver has subscription to the topics

if conditions are matched then deliver the copy of the message to my queue. 


Sender send message to Topic not to queue

Every topic has multiple subscription ( up to 2000 )

For each subscriber copy of the message will 

Subscription is a virtual queue that holds messages.

### Filters

boolean filter 
SQL filter : sql like sub set of filter conditions exists, is null, text pattern matching 
correlation filter: exact case sensitive match 
application defined property like tenant id. example if tenant id = 43 then only send the copy to subscriber. 

Action: are to modify the message that u r receiving before it delivered when filter has match.

![](https://imgur.com/blET47j.png)


Correlation filter is faster than sql filter

subscriptions are virtual queue

subscriber receives from those virtual queues.


## Topologies

topic with forwarding

subscription as working queue 

setup rules that match subscription

then in subscription u can forward to queue 

![](https://imgur.com/5t4MGUZ.png)
then u just write functions to receive from the queue.

NSB does the same.

## Atomic Sends

Batch multiple messages together and they either successful or fail together. Transaction ways to send or role back together. 



Create Transaction  flow and send 

![](https://imgur.com/undefined.png)

scope is complete then only message becom visible in destination queue. 

![](https://imgur.com/vd6yBlB.png)


## Batching 

latency optimization technique not cost 
![](https://imgur.com/X36EfDY.png)
send 10 messages to one single call to ASB so bandwidth will be heigher. But you get less latency
![](https://imgur.com/HKlwwtz.png)
standard 250 kb 
100 msg in single trnasation then sdk excpeiotn

queue of sb message


get single batch 

Try Add will return false if batch is full 

Calculates message size and if u r standard 250kb if u reach the threshold for premium 1MB size of messages in batch 
![](https://imgur.com/L9NTk4G.png)

This will throw 

![](https://imgur.com/6xDnpcN.png)

#### Want to send more message in batch ? 
Send more messages then upgrade to premium tier. 

Use `ServiceBus.AttachmentPlugin` with new sdk


## Send Via 

allows u to have an atomic 

one incoming and all out going messages. 


if exception then all messages go out to all destinations

incoming go to transfer queue 

when incoming messsage is success 
![](https://imgur.com/nW1bnD6.png)

then only outgoing message will go to the outgoing queues. 
![](https://imgur.com/S3sXoWY.png)
it cannot be done on multiple sb client it should be in same client.

witout send via

## Summary

predictable throughput 
tight SLA on your ASB instance then use premium tier

premium has more available more through put
VNET support . 1mb message size. 



ASB uses: 
- send via
- Topologies 
- service pulse  , service control 
  - all messages bring back to destination queue from deadlitter


how move dead litter to original queue 

create a receiver from the deadlitter which sends the message to original receivers. 


batching 
put more messages in one single call 
and deliver to queue
send 10 msg in one single call in one batch
they become atomic in that sense. 
send message with some size limit that is one that is batch. If the call is success they will be delivered together.
