> Do you have a lot of JavaScript projects using GitHub repositories? How are you managing dependencies among those projects? Developers might be struggling to manage a large set of GitHub repositories and Business might be spending a lot of money to manage them. The potential solution to this problem is Monorepo. You can put all of your JavaScript projects regardless of framework (angular, vue.js, react.js) in a single GitHub repository called monorepo. This will solve the problem and you will not have many Git projects. However, nothing is free! So there are many challenges with monorepo that developers are facing. I will explain all of the challenges and show you how you can solve them. Also I will create monorepo from scratch in this article using angular projects as samples.

## What is Monorepo?

Single Git Repository holds source code of multiple applications and libraries.

## Why to use Monorepo?

Monorepo in organization helps you to get below benefits:

- **Shared Code**: Reuse code validation, tooling code, and libraries code in applications in a single repository.
- **Atomic Changes**: Change the button component in the shared library and update the application that uses that button in the same commit.
- **Developer Mobility**: Developers can easily contribute to any applications or libraries by just going to one source code repository.

## What should I know before using Monorepo?

If you have already developed couple of JavaScript projects then you are good to go and learn Monorepo. For this article if you have basic knowledge of Angular then it will be good since I will create angular projects in example monorepo.

## Where is source code for Nx Monorepo?

Here is the [Nx npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nx) that you can use from npm. For this article I will demonstrate code that is hosted in github at below location:

- [Angular Monorepo Nrwl.NX sample](https://github.com/rupeshtiwari/coding-examples-angular-monorepo-with-nx)
- [Angular Monorepo Nrwl.NX sample with advance Microsoft Azure CI/CD Pipeline](https://github.com/rupeshtiwari/coding-examples-angular-monorepo-nx-azure-ci-cd)

## Challenges with Monorepo?

Challenges are how to identify which application depends on how many projects? How to constrain dependency so that it reduces cyclic dependency issues and organizes code structure? How to only compile the project which has only changed? How to only run tests for the changed projects? How to increase tooling speed for a large set of projects in a single monorepo? How to manage versions? All of these are very important requirements. Nx.Nrwl monorepo framework is an excellent framework to manage any number of JavaScript projects in just one GitHub Repo. With Nx.Nrwl Monorepo you get facility to visualize which project depends on others. All of the challenges that I mentioned could be resolved by Nx Monorepo. Stay tuned and read this article till the end to create your angular monorepo from scratch using the Nx Monorepo framework.

## How to manage versions and parallel development?

You could have your own policy as per your organization's need to manage parallel development, release, fix, development, merging, major release, maintenance related work. However, I am suggesting one option. Let's see if that makes sense to you.

### Managing Releases with Monorepo

Create a branch for release number. Example `releases/11.0` treat this branch as active working branch. You can treat this as your `dev` branch.

![](https://i.imgur.com/SQUdxd4.png){: .full}

### Working on Feature Branch with Monorepo

For adding new feature or working on some new PBI or usecase. Create a features folder and put PBI number as new branch in features folder work on development and merge them in to release branch.
Example: `features/PBI123/appendOrder`

### Managing Major Releases with Monorepo

In order to do major release create a new branch `11.1` as major release branch. And if you want to apply fix on `11.1` then create another branch `11.1.1` work on fixes and merge them back to release branch `11.0` for future release.

## What Developer will learn in this article?

In this article, I will walk you through the steps to create one [nx monorepo](https://nx.dev/) workspace with Angular application and libraries from empty preset.

1. We will use Azure Pipeline Caching to improve build speed by caching npm packages.
2. We will publish our application to npm from pipeline in automated fashion.

### In the Monorepo we will do below work

1. I need **Karma** as test runner
2. I **don't need e2e test** for applications
3. I want my **applications to be publishable**
4. I want my **libraries to be not publishable**
5. Create **Azure CI/CD pipelines**
6. Deploy **Application to NPM registry**

## Development Environment Setup

Hey developer, make sure you have `node.js` installed which is greater than `V10`. I have installed `node.js v14`.

### Visual Studio Code (VsCode)

I am using Vs Code and installed nx console extension to get inbuilt way of creating apps/libs from nx console only.

### Visual Studio Code Extensions

Install below VsCode extensions for better development experience:

- [Nx Console](https://nx.dev/latest/angular/getting-started/console) in your vs code to create components without writing code.

## Enable Karma Test Runner in Nx Monorepo

When you create nx monorepo with `Angular` or `React` or `Next.js` or `Gatsby` or `next.js` or `Web Components` then it will give you `JEST` as unit test runner. In case you want to get `karma` test runner then you have to create Empty workspace and then add `@nrwl/angular` then add new application or lib with karma unit test runner.

## Creating First Nx Monorepo using CLI

In order to create your first Nx Monorepo workspace run below script:

`npx create-nx-workspace@latest`

- Give workspace name: `myorg`
- Select Layout: I select Angular Application (A workspace with a single Angular Application)
- Application Name: cutepuppies-admin
- Stylesheet Format: SASS
- Linter: TSLINT
- Nx Cloud: No ( this is default )

![](https://i.imgur.com/iMK98Jr.png){: .full}

It will create the workspace with angular app that we defined.

![](https://i.imgur.com/X8fvsUc.png){: .full}

When you will use their template they will add end to end test for application. They will also add jest test runner.

![](https://i.imgur.com/GLOkklz.png){: .full}

In my workspace, I do not want Jest and I do not want e2e tests. So I am creating my workspace with empty preset next.

## Creating Nx Monorepo with Custom Settings

1.  Run `npx create-nx-workspace@latest`

2.  Give organization name: `curise`

3.  Select angular application for the workspace. `angular`

This will install `@nrwl/angular` plugin to give you tools to create angular lib and apps.

![](https://i.imgur.com/zia6hBU.png){: .full}

4.  Then enter angular application name: admin

![](https://i.imgur.com/jn9PH3x.png){: .full}

5.  Next select Style format as SASS
6.  Default Linter: Choose TSLINT since I have angular app
7.  Nx Cloud give caching over cloud: No ( it needs paid subscription plan)

![](https://i.imgur.com/8XevXrP.png){: .full}

Run the script:
![](https://i.imgur.com/roU0Y90.png){: .full}

## Understanding Nx Monorepo Workspace

![](https://i.imgur.com/bNRYcQI.png){: .full}

1. **Apps**
2. **libs**
3. **tools**
   Tools folder has tsconfig file that means u can write typescript files and compile them in JS.
4. **decorate-angular-cli.js**
5. **jest.preset.js**
6. **angular.json**
   It create angular.json file to manage your workspace. However, if you want to create empty monorepo project then it creates **workspace.json** file.

## Creating Projects in Nx Monorepo

Run `nx build`

![](https://i.imgur.com/Pig0oei.png){: .full}

Showing `dist` folder.

![](https://i.imgur.com/wIjX2a2.png){: .full}

## Empty Nx Monorepo Advantage and Disadvantages

After creating empty workspace.

**Benefits of Empty Workspace**

1. You can use `karma` unit test runner
2. You can use `workspace.json` to configure any apps and libs.

**Disadvantages of empty workspace**:

1. You have to write the angular cli decorator for `Nx CLI`

Regardless of empty or pre-populated workspace you must create your own `CI/CD` Pipelines and Nx commands for your pipelines.

## Creating new Empty Nx Monorepo workspace

Now we will create our monorepo workslpace that we will continue using it. We will start from scratch empty monorepo.

Creating empty Nx Monorepo workspace is our final option for this example. So let's create desired working folder and from that location open `powershell` on windows machine I found working on `git bash commands` were not working nicely.

Run below script to create empty workspace

`npx create-nx-workspace@latest --preset=empty`

Above script will ask you

1. organization name and
2. Want to use Nx Cloud or not.

![](https://i.imgur.com/2nPySWd.png){: .full}

Notice it created the workspace

![](https://i.imgur.com/ApKE767.png){: .full}

So Now I get empty app and library folders.

![](https://i.imgur.com/vl5KtTa.png){: .full}

This is my dependencies that I get in package.json

![](https://i.imgur.com/Y4qQNIe.png){: .full}

## What NX CLI does?

`Nx CLI` commands will invoke `Angular CLI`. The `Nx CLI` simply does some optimizations before invoking the `Angular CLI`. `Nx Cli` can execute all of the `ng cli` commands. The benefit you get with `Nx CLI` is **Computation Caching** which gives faster execution of tasks. Also Nx CLI is technology agnostic You can use `Nx CLI` to run `angular`, `react`, `JavaScript` or any project scripts.
So it gives uniformity in your team to always run `Nx CLI` in your workspace regardless of any front-end technology you are using..

## Using Nx CLI over Angular CLI

In order to point `ng cli` to `Nx CLI` we have to run **decorate-angular-cli.js** file. Because of `symlinking` you can still type `ng build` or `ng test` or `ng lint` in the terminal. The ng command, in this case, will point to nx, which will perform optimizations before invoking `ng`.

After install we can execute this decorator file.

```json
"postinstall": "node ./decorate-angular-cli.js && ngcc --properties es2015 browser module main --first-only --create-ivy-entry-points",
```

## How to opt out of NX CLI

Although I don't recommend this option :-1:  
However, in case you want to opt out of `NX CLI` then follow below steps:

1.  Replace occurrences of nx with ng in your package.json
2.  Remove the script from your postinstall script in your package.json
3.  Delete and reinstall your node_modules

We are not doing this though.

## Understanding NX Workspace Scripts

```json
"scripts": {
    "nx": "nx",
    "start": "nx serve",
    "build": "nx build",
    "test": "nx test",
    "lint": "nx workspace-lint && nx lint",
    "e2e": "nx e2e",
    "affected:apps": "nx affected:apps",
    "affected:libs": "nx affected:libs",
    "affected:build": "nx affected:build",
    "affected:e2e": "nx affected:e2e",
    "affected:test": "nx affected:test",
    "affected:lint": "nx affected:lint",
    "affected:dep-graph": "nx affected:dep-graph",
    "affected": "nx affected",
    "format": "nx format:write",
    "format:write": "nx format:write",
    "format:check": "nx format:check",
    "update": "nx migrate latest",
    "workspace-generator": "nx workspace-generator",
    "dep-graph": "nx dep-graph",
    "help": "nx help"
  },
```

## Creating Angular Library using Nx Console

I will use `nx console` to create application.

Since I want to create Angular applications and libraries I need `@nrwl/angular` node package to be
installed.

please run below script to install `@nrwl/angular`

`npm i -D @nrwl/angular`

![](https://i.imgur.com/uq8rqan.png){: .full}

Select Nx, then select generate and then select Angular Library.

![](https://i.imgur.com/NzsCaoS.png){: .full}

Fill out the required fields. I want to create logger angular library under lib/branding folder with karma testing framework.

![](https://i.imgur.com/rNAerhj.png){: .full}

This is my dry run result

![](https://i.imgur.com/Erh9MXZ.png){: .full}

Logger project is created successfully.
![](https://i.imgur.com/OM0IQE3.png){: .full}

## How to stop dryRun while using Nx Console?

Currently there is no way you can stop dry run therefore, use the script to create application or lib.

```shell
nx generate @nrwl/angular:library --name=utils --directory=branding --importPath=@myor/branding-utils --prefix=myorg-branding-utils --tags=scope:branding,type:branding-utils --no-interactive --dry-run
```

## Creating JS project using NX Console

NX Monorepo only support `JEST` or `NONE` unit test runner for Javascript project.

```shell
nx generate @nrwl/workspace:library --name=ckeditor5 --directory=branding --importPath=@myorg/branding-ckeditor5 --prefix=myorg-branding-ckeditor5 --tags=scope:branding,type:branding-ckeditor5 --no-interactive --js --unitTestRunner=none --dry-run
```

## How to create Run Command in NX Monorepo

Nx Run Command helps to create custom commands

![](https://i.imgur.com/6OPfuS6.png){: .full}

**Target Name** : Bane of the target like `build`
**Project Name** : is the name of the project in the workspace.json file : `branding-ckeditor`

**Command**: `npm run build`

**cwd** location of the src folder of the project

**outputs** where the build artifacts will be stored.
![](https://i.imgur.com/BS0ulgd.png){: .full}

```shell
nx generate @nrwl/workspace:run-commands --name=build --command='npm run build' --project=branding-ckeditor5 --cwd=libs/branding/ckeditor5/src --outputs=libs/branding/ckeditor5 --no-interactive --dry-run
```

This will update the `workspace.json` and `nx.json`

![](https://i.imgur.com/JYPutPu.png){: .full}

Now you can run `nx build branding-ckeditor5`

## Step: Create Angular App using Nx Console

Let's select an angular application this time to create cutepuppies-admin apps.
![](https://i.imgur.com/XRG6STh.png){: .full}

Name: cutepuppies-admin
![](https://i.imgur.com/QNPMMpp.png){: .full}

e2eTestRunner: none ( I don't want this test )

Click on the Run button and finally select SASS while it is asking for which style format.
See my app is created
![](https://i.imgur.com/fAz1Q1y.png){: .full}

## Adding Nx CLI Decorator for Nx Empty Workspace

## Step : Let's Create Logging Service & Tests

Let's create a loggingService inside our logger project.
Use Nx Console to create angular service.
![](https://i.imgur.com/ynFGEdp.png){: .full}

This is dry run result of angular service creation
![](https://i.imgur.com/oyCwe1b.png){: .full}

Fill out the form add below information
![](https://i.imgur.com/SZDx1N5.png){: .full}

Name: logging
project: branding-logger
Notice Logger service created
![](https://i.imgur.com/7aLT4Yn.png){: .full}

Lets run the test and see if the test is passing or not. Since I am using main branch instead of master branch I will update my scripts to take base as main branch only.

![](https://i.imgur.com/LQmjidP.png){: .full}

Since only logging service is added if I run the test only one project test will run.
Run npm run affected:test
![](https://i.imgur.com/owTmYZl.png){: .full}

## Step : Let's take logger dependency on our application

Next lest run the build
![](https://i.imgur.com/2OAeDSS.png){: .full}

npm run affected:build
![](https://i.imgur.com/wfr90IZ.png){: .full}

Notice the app is building and the dist folder is created with one app.

![](https://i.imgur.com/noosk8r.png){: .full}

Now let's use a logging service to log something and run our application next.

Go to libs/branding/logger/src/index.ts and export the logger service.

![](https://i.imgur.com/7w7SM23.png){: .full}

Next go to apps\cutepuppies-admin\src\app\app.component.ts and add logging service and log in constructor.
![](https://i.imgur.com/QGpa6da.png){: .full}

Lets serve our application run below script

nx serve cutepuppies-admin

![](https://i.imgur.com/wyde0hs.png){: .full}

Navigate to http://localhost:4200 and see in console log hello world is coming.

![](https://i.imgur.com/FMj0LWO.png){: .full}

Now lets build the application again and go to the dist folder and run below script from dist folder

cd dist/apps/cutepuppies-admin && npx http-server -o

Notice our app is running and I see the log as well.

## MonoRepo Workspace Architecture

**Apps**

- Apps are IT-Ops systems
- It can depend on anything
- Only apps are buildable and publishable to npm repositories.

**Libs**

- Libs are services
- Services should have multiple projects
- Services should not depend on each other
- Services projects should not depend on each other. Unless it is configured to do so.
- Services projects can depend on Branding
- Services projects are not buildable and not publishable
- Services projects has a libs folder which is equivalent to modules folder.

## Creating Build CI pipeline

Install [yaml visual studio extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml)
![](https://i.imgur.com/T9rDvmQ.png){: .full}

Install [Azure Pipelines](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azure-devops.azure-pipelines) for validations of yml file

### Caching Azure Pipeline

We will install node modules and cache it so that for future build it will read from the cache location. If package-lock.json is changed it will refresh the cache.

We are going to use **Restores and saves pipeline artifacts with Universal Packages** to cache the ci pipelines. So Install the Task in your azure devops from marketplace.

[Restores and saves pipeline artifacts with Universal Packages](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=1ESLighthouseEng.PipelineArtifactCaching)
![](https://i.imgur.com/pNN6xl4.png){: .full}

Since we are use pipeline cache, we need to create Artifacts Feed in Azure devops to store the node_modules folders. [Learn more about Artifacts Feed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/artifacts/concepts/feeds?view=azure-devops)

## Create Artifact Feed in Azure devops

> Artifacts Feeds are organizational constructs that allow you to store, manage, and group your packages and control who to share it with. Feeds are not package-type dependent. You can store all the following package types in a single feed: npm, NuGet, Maven, Python, and Universal packages.

1. Go to Azure Artifacts.
   ![](https://i.imgur.com/DaCSK2x.png){: .full}
2. Select Create Feed.
   ![](https://i.imgur.com/jST8Fj8.png){: .full}
3. Give your feed a Name and choose its visibility, upstream sources and scope.

## Creating Azure CI Pipeline

Follow steps to create build definition

### Step 1: Create Template yaml File

Then go to project and create install-node-module.yml file:
![](https://i.imgur.com/fLed9Hi.png){: .full}

1. We will install node.js
2. We will write the task to cache the node_modules folder into the azure feed.
3. Then we will install node packages if cache does not exist.

```yaml
steps:
  - task: NodeTool@0
    inputs:
      versionSpec: '14.x'
    displayName: 'Install Node.js'
  - task: 1ESLighthouseEng.PipelineArtifactCaching.RestoreAndSaveCacheV1.RestoreAndSaveCache@1
    inputs:
      keyfile: '**/package-lock.json, !**/node_modules/**/package-lock.json, !**/.*/**/package-lock.json'
      targetfolder: '$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/node_modules'
      vstsFeed: 'nx_azure_node_modules_cache_feed'
  - script: |
      npm ci --ignore-engines
    displayName: Install dependencies only if there is no cache available
    condition: ne(variables['CacheRestored'], 'true')
```

### Step 2: Generate the ci script dynamically

![](https://i.imgur.com/yRtHDzM.png){: .full}

```javascript
/**
 * # Generate Ci command
 * 1. It will identify the affected projects
 * 2. Group the projects in 3 groups for each command.
 * ## Example:
 *  If 3 projects are affected it will create below group for lint, test and build command
 *          lint1:[admin], lint2:[logger], lint3:[client]
 *          build1:[admin], build2:[logger], build3:[client]( if you made buildable for each projects)
 *          test1:[admin], test2:[logger], test3:[client]( if you have tests for each projects)
 *  If 4 projects are affected it will create below group for lint, test and build command
 *          lint1:[admin,ngmaterial], lint2:[logger], lint3:[client]
 *          build1:[admin,ngmaterial], build2:[logger], build3:[client]( if you made buildable for each projects)
 *          test1:[admin,ngmaterial], test2:[logger], test3:[client] ( if you have tests for each projects)
 */

const execSync = require('child_process').execSync;
const isMaster = process.argv[2] === 'False';
const baseSha = isMaster ? 'origin/main~1' : 'origin/main';

console.log(
  JSON.stringify({
    ...commands('lint'),
    ...commands('test'),
    ...commands('build'),
  })
);

function commands(target) {
  const array = JSON.parse(
    execSync(`npx nx print-affected --base=${baseSha} --target=${target}`)
      .toString()
      .trim()
  ).tasks.map((t) => t.target.project);

  array.sort(() => 0.5 - Math.random());
  const third = Math.floor(array.length / 3);
  const a1 = array.slice(0, third);
  const a2 = array.slice(third, third * 2);
  const a3 = array.slice(third * 2);
  return {
    [target + '1']: a1,
    [target + '2']: a2,
    [target + '3']: a3,
  };
}
```

### Step : Create azure-pipelines.yml file

![](https://i.imgur.com/2oCIB4J.png){: .full}

```yaml
trigger:
  - main # Trigger CI automatically whenever main branch is changed

jobs:
  - job: initial_setup # Install Node.js & Node Packages & Generate Commands for Affected Projects.
    pool:
      vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
    variables:
      IS_PR: $[ eq(variables['Build.Reason'], 'PullRequest') ] # Findout Is this pull request?
    steps:
      - template: .azure-pipelines/steps/install-node-modules.yml # Base Template
      - powershell: echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=COMMANDS;isOutput=true]$(node ./tools/scripts/generate-ci-commands.js $(IS_PR))" # Create COMMANDS build time variable and assign ci commands.
        name: setCommands
      - script: echo $(setCommands.COMMANDS) # Echo the command for log purpose.
        name: echoCommands
```

### Step : Lets Run the Build

![](https://i.imgur.com/GOUP7Se.png){: .full}

Select run
![](https://i.imgur.com/sO8rVJ0.png){: .full}

This time we have not changed the code therefore no build command created.
![](https://i.imgur.com/JxNUOsa.png){: .full}

### Step : Create Run Many JavaScript

![](https://i.imgur.com/bEu4amr.png){: .full}

In order to run the lint, test and build we have to create run-many.js file where we will put our script.

```javascript
/**
 * # Run Many
 * It will run the script using nx command line to run them in parellel.
 */

const execSync = require('child_process').execSync;

const commands = JSON.parse(process.argv[2]);
const projects = commands[process.argv[3]];
const target = process.argv[4];
execSync(
  `npx nx run-many --target=${target} --projects=${projects.join(
    ','
  )} --parallel`,
  {
    stdio: [0, 1, 2],
  }
);
```

### Step : Add lint, test and build scripts

```yaml
trigger:
  - main # Trigger CI automatically whenever main branch is changed

jobs:
  - job: initial_setup # Install Node.js & Node Packages & Generate Commands for Affected Projects.
    pool:
      vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
    variables:

```

### Step : Lets Run the build Again

Notice since we have not changed any code we will notice only initial_setup and rest all jobs will be skipped.

![](https://i.imgur.com/QiHKC9V.png){: .full}

### Step : Lets Change the Logger and find out affected dependency graph

Go libs\branding\logger\src\lib\logging.service.ts
![](https://i.imgur.com/aeU11m5.png){: .full}

Run `npm run affected:dep-graph`

![](https://i.imgur.com/Tu2E3ML.png){: .full}

confirm changes are working Run `npm run start-admin`

![](https://i.imgur.com/iVTsegC.png){: .full}

### Step: Fix admin specs

Lets create a script to test and watch
![](https://i.imgur.com/FTvQoP8.png){: .full}

Now lets fix the test for admin project correct the title name
Now run `npm run affected:test`

It will automatically run the admin test.

![](https://i.imgur.com/zxF2qE5.png){: .full}

### Step: Fix client specs

Now lest fix the test for client project correct the title name
Now run `npm run affected:test`
It will automatically run the both admin & client test.
![](https://i.imgur.com/WAnxb3L.png){: .full}

![](https://i.imgur.com/8tn43Vi.png){: .full}

### Step : Lets Push the code and notice our Builds

See this time in the build machine as well it identified

1. Only 2 projects to lint and test and they are
   1. "branding-logger","cutepuppies-admin"
2. Only 1 Project to build and that is:"cutepuppies-admin"

Notice test and build are passing

![](https://i.imgur.com/Yj8uQdv.png){: .full}

### Step : Running all lint build and test as TASK

We dont want to trigger these many jobs since our monorepo is not that large. Therefore, I am deciding to create just one job so lets follow below steps.

### Step: Update the command generation script

Lets update the build definition to run them as task within single job.

Rename the current file to generate-ci-batch-commands.js
And create new file generate-ci-commands.js
![](https://i.imgur.com/RK1V28L.png){: .full}

```javascript
/**
 * # Generate Ci command
 * 1. It will identify the affected projects
 * 2. Group the projects in 3 groups for each command.
 * ## Example:
 *  If 3 projects are affected it will create below group for lint, test and build command
 *          lint1:[admin], lint2:[logger], lint3:[client]
 *          build1:[admin], build2:[logger], build3:[client]( if you made buildable for each projects)
 *          test1:[admin], test2:[logger], test3:[client]( if you have tests for each projects)
 *  If 4 projects are affected it will create below group for lint, test and build command
 *          lint1:[admin,ngmaterial], lint2:[logger], lint3:[client]
 *          build1:[admin,ngmaterial], build2:[logger], build3:[client]( if you made buildable for each projects)
 *          test1:[admin,ngmaterial], test2:[logger], test3:[client] ( if you have tests for each projects)
 */
debugger;
const execSync = require('child_process').execSync;
const isMaster = process.argv[2] === 'False';
const baseSha = isMaster ? 'origin/main~1' : 'origin/main';

console.log(
  JSON.stringify({
    ...commands('lint'),
    ...commands('test'),
    ...commands('build'),
  })
);

function commands(target) {
  const array = JSON.parse(
    execSync(`npx nx print-affected --base=${baseSha} --target=${target}`)
      .toString()
      .trim()
  ).tasks.map((t) => t.target.project);

  return { [target]: array };
}
```

If you run this script, after changing logger project. It will generate the commands for the affected projects. Like below

```json
{
  "lint": ["cutepuppies-admin", "branding-logger"],
  "test": ["cutepuppies-admin", "branding-logger"],
  "build": ["cutepuppies-admin"]
}
```

### Step : Update the azure-pipeline yml to have Steps not jobs

Rename the current azure-pipeline yml
![](https://i.imgur.com/tNAGfrK.png){: .full}

and move to .azure-pipeline/steps folder for future use or backup.

![](https://i.imgur.com/67QekSa.png){: .full}

azure-pipelines.yml

```yaml

        ))
      )

  - script: node ./tools/scripts/run-many.js '$(COMMANDS)' test
    displayName: testing
    condition: |
      and(
        succeeded(),
        not(contains(
            variables['COMMANDS'],
            '"test":[]'
        ))
      )
  - script: node ./tools/scripts/run-many.js '$(COMMANDS)' build
    displayName: building
    condition: |
      and(
        succeeded(),
        not(contains(
            variables['COMMANDS'],
            '"build":[]'
        ))
      )
```

Run build

### Step : Change logging service only and run build

![](https://i.imgur.com/tWw04V4.png){: .full}

Run build

![](https://i.imgur.com/IGmdmo1.png){: .full}

Build Success
![](https://i.imgur.com/8F5gXDb.png){: .full}

### Step : Finding affected apps

Lets update the commands to also give a list of apps to publish in npm repository.

When We change logger we want to also see publish array with affected app.

```json
{
  "lint": ["branding-logger", "cutepuppies-admin"],
  "test": ["branding-logger", "cutepuppies-admin"],
  "build": ["cutepuppies-admin"],
  "publish": ["cutepuppies-admin"]
}
```

If I change the client app as well then I should see both apps in publish array.

```json
{
  "lint": ["cutepuppies-client", "branding-logger", "cutepuppies-admin"],
  "test": ["cutepuppies-client", "branding-logger", "cutepuppies-admin"],
  "build": ["cutepuppies-client", "cutepuppies-admin"],
  "publish": ["cutepuppies-client", "cutepuppies-admin"]
}
```

I will add below method for getting publish apps

```javascript
function affectedApps(command) {
  const x = execSync(`npx nx affected:apps --base=${baseSha}`)
    .toString()
    .trim();

  let apps = x ? x.split('\n\n')[1].split(' - ').slice(1) : [];
  apps = apps.map((t) => t.replace('\n', '').trim());

  return { [command]: apps };
}
```

The new script for `generate-ci-command.js`

```javascript
const execSync = require('child_process').execSync;
const isMaster = process.argv[2] === 'False';
const baseSha = isMaster ? 'origin/main~1' : 'origin/main';

console.log(
  JSON.stringify({
    ...commands('lint'),
    ...commands('test'),
    ...commands('build'),
    ...affectedApps('publish'), // publish command for the apps
  })
);

function commands(target) {
  const array = JSON.parse(
    execSync(`npx nx print-affected --base=${baseSha} --target=${target}`)
      .toString()
      .trim()
  ).tasks.map((t) => t.target.project);

  return { [target]: array };
}

function affectedApps(command) {
  const x = execSync(`npx nx affected:apps --base=${baseSha}`)
    .toString()
    .trim();

  let apps = x ? x.split('\n\n')[1].split(' - ').slice(1) : [];
  apps = apps.map((t) => t.replace('\n', '').trim());

  return { [command]: apps };
}
```

### Step : Lets Add Package.json in applications

Admin app package.json
![](https://i.imgur.com/FBImW9k.png){: .full}

Client app package.json

![](https://i.imgur.com/dsaUa6N.png){: .full}

![](https://i.imgur.com/FtHLQEb.png){: .full}

### Step : Update workspace.json for app

In order to copy package.json file after build in the dist folder update the workspace file.

admin project
![](https://i.imgur.com/Wksie6X.png){: .full}

client project

![](https://i.imgur.com/FiXMBLL.png){: .full}

### Step : Build in Production Mode

I want to build my angular app with below

1. production mode
2. no output file hashing
3. I want source map file so that I can debug my source file.

Below is the nx build command to fulfill above requirements

```shell=
nx run-many --target=build --projects=cutepuppies-client,cutepuppies-admin --parallel --configuration=production --outputHashing=none --sourceMap=true
```

Run above nx build command

![](https://i.imgur.com/qFdZhxH.png){: .full}

Notice in the dist folder in admin folder we got map file and package.json
![](https://i.imgur.com/xZq2B3J.png){: .full}
client project

### Step: Updating Package.json Version & Publish Npm package

```javascript
/**
 * . bump the version
 * . add npmrc file (if required)
 * . publish to npm package repository
 *
 * Example: node ./publish-npm.js $(COMMANDS) $(Build.BuildNumber)
 *
 */

const execSync = require('child_process').execSync;
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
var basePackageJson = require('../../package.json');
const args = {
  commands: process.argv[2],
  buildNumber: process.argv[3],
};

console.log('Received Args: ', args, '\n');

if (!args.commands) {
  throw new Error('Commands are required');
}

const commands = JSON.parse(args.commands);
/*
let commands = {
  publish: ['cutepuppies-admin', 'cutepuppies-client'],
};
*/

if (!args.buildNumber) {
  throw new Error('Build Number is required');
}
const buildNumber = args.buildNumber.toString();
// let buildNumber = '3243';

const projects = commands['publish'];

const newVersion = getNewVesrion();

console.log(`new npm version would be: ${newVersion}`, '\n');

updatePublishingPackageJsonVersion();
publishNpmPackage();

return newVersion;

function getNewVesrion() {
  let currentVersion = basePackageJson.version;

  return currentVersion
    .split('.')
    .map((x, i) => (i == 2 ? buildNumber : x))
    .join('.');
}

function updatePublishingPackageJsonVersion() {
  projects.forEach((project) => {
    updateVersion(
      path.resolve(__dirname, '../../', `dist/apps/${project}/package.json`)
    );
  });
}

function updateVersion(packageJsonFilePath) {
  var package = require(packageJsonFilePath);
  package.version = newVersion;
  fs.writeFileSync(packageJsonFilePath, JSON.stringify(package, null, 2));

  console.log(
    `Version updated for the app ${package.name}: ${newVersion}`,
    '\n'
  );
}

function publishNpmPackage() {
  projects.forEach((app) => {
    const cwd = path.resolve(__dirname, '../../', `dist/apps/${app}`);
    console.log(`publishing to npm from: `, cwd, '\n');

    execSync(
      `npm publish --access public`,
      { cwd, stdio: [0, 1, 2] },
      function (error) {
        console.log(error, '\n');

        throw error;
      }
    );
    console.log(`${app} is published`, newVersion, '\n');
  });
}
```

### Step : Push you changes and Trigger Build

See both admin and client is published.

## Karma failing when no test present

Karma test will fail if u have not tests.
Therefore, if you want to stop this behavior then you need to go to `karma.conf.js` at root location where u see `package.json` and add below flag as false.

```json
    failOnEmptyTestSuite: false
```

## Monorepo Architecture Guideline for developers

### What do smart components do?Â 

- It can do dependency injection and have service storesÂ  injected.
- It can only send command
- It can only call query methods to store to get some result/data
- It can not write any filter,sort kind of logic move them in store
- It can not publish event
- It can not have business query logic or model update logic
- It can pass some data structure to nested dumb/presentation components

### What is dumb / presentation componetn can do?

- No dependency injection for service and store
- Only input and output
- Responsible for rendering data
- No message publishing/sending
- No store query no model state mutation

### What is a service?

1.  It has business logic and
2.  It can take advantage of API service.
3.  Most of the services are message handlers.

Quiz: Where should I write the code to create a mcq widget?

### What is a Model?

- It is a data structure which has state.

- It must not have business logic.
- It can have getters and setters.

### What is a Store?Â 

Is a collection of models.Â  If you have multiple models of the same type, create store to retrieve them and put them in the collection.

1.  Donâ€™t write business logic to mutate the model state in store
2.  Business logic to mutate model state goes in SERVICES only.
3.  All Model related queries (filter, sort etc ) must be written in the Store that component can call upon.
4.  Store we can write code that does not go in one model and you want span over the multiple instances of the model.

5.  Example: Sorting models inside store, Asserting before inserting model in collection.

### What is an API service?

1.  Makes http network calls and returns promises.
2.  It has httpClient dependency and extends Base API Service.
3.  API service mostly returns the client side Model object and Server is supposed to return the same Model Data Structure to the client. However, in case there is a mismatch between the result comes from Server vs client. Then Use DTO for server side data structure. DTO should remain under the DATA folder of the project.

### Who depends on whom within a library ?Â 

We have component layer, message handlers and api service layers.

- Component can depend on Model and Message service
- Message Handler can depend on model and api
- API service can depend on httpclient and dto

### Before Push to Git Guidelines

âœ… RUN TEST: npm run affected:test
âœ… RUN LINT: npm run affected:lint

You can always run affected projects on your feature branch by giving its name.

```
npm run affected:test --base=origin/features/PBI23/MessageHandlers
npm run affected:lint --base=origin/features/PBI23/MessageHandlers
```

### Naming conventions

Feel free to follow any naming conventions provided in your organization. Here is what I recommend:

### Nx Related Questions

- **Does the lib projects have npm versions?**
  **Answer:** No, because they are not buildable and publishable.

- **How should we branch in monorepo ?**
  **Answer:** V1, V2, V3 are the branches for the monorepo.

- **When do we create branches ?**
  **Answer:** As you move your code to a new environment it is recommended to create a separate branch in monorepo.
