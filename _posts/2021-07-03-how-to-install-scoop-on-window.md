## ðŸ¥‡Coloring your PowerShell

1. Open PowerShell profile normally it is at `c:\users\<username>\My Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`. Run $profile to learn where is your profile. If not then create new one.
2. Add below script in profile file.

```shell
Invoke-Expression (oh-my-posh --init --shell pwsh --config "$(scoop prefix oh-my-posh)/themes/nu4a.omp.json")
```

### Installing on-my-posh

Run `scoop install https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/releases/latest/download/oh-my-posh.json` to install **on-my-post**.

This installs a couple of things:

1. `oh-my-posh.exe` - Windows executable, added to your $PATH
2. `oh-my-posh-wsl` - Linux executable, added to your $PATH for use in the WSL
3. `themes` - The latest Oh my Posh themes

### Install Nerd Fonts

**Oh-My-Posh** needs Nerd Font therefore, you must install them.

1. [Download Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)
2. After downloading font install it.
3. Open PowerShell and select your Nerd Font. I am using `MesloLGL NF` Font.

## ðŸ›• Changing Theme

### Visualizing All Themes

### Changing Theme of PowerShell

Once you select your new theme then open PowerShell profile and change the theme `json` name. I have currently `themes\nu4a.omp.json` I will switch to `themes\cert`. With below new script

```powershell
Invoke-Expression (oh-my-posh --init --shell pwsh --config "$(scoop prefix oh-my-posh)/themes/cert.omp.json")ðŸ‘ˆ

```

Look at my new theme now ![](https://imgur.com/p6wHB52.png)

All done ðŸŽ‰ enjoy power of `scoop` and coolness of `PowerShell` on your windows machine.
