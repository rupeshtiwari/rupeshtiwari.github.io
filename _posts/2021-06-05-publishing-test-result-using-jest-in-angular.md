> Are you wondering how to publish **Test Results** over **Azure CI Build** while using **Angular** and **JEST**? In this article I will demonstrate **nx monorepo** publishing test results using **azure pipeline**.

If you are u are using Karma Test Runner then read my previous article [Publishing Nx Monorepo Test Results in Azure CI Pipeline](https://www.rupeshtiwari.com/blog/publishing-nx-monorepo-test-results-in-azure-ci-pipeline/).

## Azure Publish Test Results Task

I am using **Azure CI build** to build, test and deploy my Angular App.

### Azure Publish Test Result Task Name

We will use Azure Task **`PublishTestResults@2`** to publish our angular test results to **Azure Pipelines**.

### Supported Test Results Formats

As of now Azure Task only supports below Test Result formats:

1. JUnit
2. NUnit
3. VSTest
4. xUnit
5. cTest

We will use **JUnit** format to publish Angular Test Result. Also just let you know that Azure The default option uses JUnit format to publish test results.

## Generating Test Results in Angular App

When we run test in Angular App Test Results files are supposed to be created.

### Installing Jest-JUnit npm Package

Since we are using JEST let's install [jest-junit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-junit) in our angular app first.

Run below script on root of your project where you see package.json file.

```shell
npm i -D jest-junit
```

### Updating Jest.Config

Let's define the JUnit Reporter config inside the Jest.Config file. Here I will define `outputDirectory` , `outputName` and `suiteName`

```
 reporters: [
    'default',
    [
      'jest-junit',
      {
        outputDirectory: 'test_results',
        outputName: 'jest-junit.xml',
        suiteName: 'Angular Inventions Tests'
      },
    ],
  ],
```

### Creating Test Script

In order to generate report we have to run the test. Add below test script in `package.json`.

```json
...
scripts :{
  "test:prod": "jest --ci"
  ...
}

```

### Generating Test Results

Let's Run `npm run test:prod` and notice our test is passing.

As well as test report created under folder `test_results`.

## Azure Pipeline Update

In order for publishing your test results on azure pipelines. You can setup your `azure-pipelines.yml` for showing test results.

### Publish Test Results YAML

```yaml
- task: PublishTestResults@2
  enabled: false
  displayName: Publish Test Results
  inputs:
    testResultsFormat: 'JUnit'
    testResultsFiles: '**/test_results/jest-junit.xml'
    mergeTestResults: true
```
