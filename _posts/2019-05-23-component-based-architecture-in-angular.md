<p>One of the main architectural principles in Angular is that an application should be composed of well encapsulated, loosely coupled components. In this session <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mogp9nxLvs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>0008-8- angular: What is Component Based Application?</strong></a> we are going to discuss about components (in the context of Angular) and how they differ from directives.<br />
At the end of this <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mogp9nxLvs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tutorial</a></strong>, you will be able to answer questions related to components and their usage in angular. You will get clear view of most frequently asked questions like<br />
- What are components?<br />
- How they encapsulate the concept of shadow routing?<br />
- What is component decorator?<br />
- What minimum metadata required in component decorator?<br />
- Can we create our own decorator, is component itself a directive etc.?<br />
It also talks about the component-based design of an application, and its comparison to traditional design methods being used. In Angular, a Component is basically a special kind of directive that uses a simpler configuration which is suitable for a component-based application structure. This makes it easier to write an app with simpler configuration than plain directives. By taking component based application development approach it is easier to build an app, modify, and enhance later.</p>
