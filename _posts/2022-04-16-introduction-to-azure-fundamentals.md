### What is Azure?

Azure is a continually expanding set of cloud services that help your organization meet your current and future business challenges. [Learn More about What is Microsoft Azure here...](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-fundamentals/what-is-microsoft-azure)

### What is Azure fundamentals?

Azure fundamentals is a series of [**six learning paths**](#exam-az-900) or six knowledge domain areas.

### Why should I take Azure fundamentals?

You boss or manager wants to use Azure in your company. So you must be prepare for it. Now a days there are many jobs available which requires Azure certifications.

Take Azure fundamentals if you:

- Have general interest in Azure or in the cloud.
- Want to earn official certification from Microsoft.

## What is cloud computing?

It's the **delivery of computing services over the internet**, which is otherwise known as the cloud. These services include servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence. Cloud computing offers faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

{: .notice--success}
üèÜ **Pro Tip** \
\
Save your company money üí∞ "You'll only need to pay for **the resources and computing time that you use**".

### Why is cloud computing typically cheaper to use?

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet by using a **pay-as-you-go** pricing model.

To put it another way, cloud computing is a way to **rent compute power and storage** from someone else's datacenter. You can treat cloud resources like you would your resources in your own datacenter. When you're done using them, you give them back. You're billed only for what you use.

Instead of maintaining CPUs and storage in your datacenter, you rent them for the time that you need them. The `cloud provider` takes care of **maintaining the underlying infrastructure** for you. The cloud enables you to quickly solve your toughest business challenges, and bring cutting-edge solutions to your users.

### Why should You move to the cloud?

In our ever-changing digital world, two trends emerge:

- Teams `deliver` new features to their users at `record speeds`.
- Users expect an increasingly `rich and immersive experience` with their devices and with software.

The cloud provides on-demand access to:

- A nearly limitless pool of raw compute, storage, and networking components.
- Speech recognition and other cognitive services that help make your application stand out from the crowd.
- Analytics services that deliver telemetry data from your software and devices.

### What are some cloud computing advantages?

{: .notice--success}
üèÜ **Pro Tip** \
\
Remember the sentence [**GASHED**](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/gashed).
**G** = **G**eo-distribution
**A** = **A**gility
**S** = **S**calability
**H** = **H**igh availability
**E** = **E**lasticity
**D** = **D**isaster recovery

üëá Below are also called as cloud concepts:

- **Geo-distribution**: You can deploy apps and data to regional datacenters around the globe, thereby ensuring that your customers always have the best performance in their region.

- **Agility**: Deploy and configure cloud-based resources quickly as your app requirements change.

- **Scalability**: Apps in the cloud can scale _vertically_ and _horizontally_:

  - Scale vertically to increase compute capacity by adding RAM or CPUs to a virtual machine.
  - Scaling horizontally increases compute capacity by adding instances of resources, such as adding VMs to the configuration.

- **High availability**: Depending on the service-level agreement (SLA) that you choose, your cloud-based apps can provide a continuous user experience with no apparent downtime, even when things go wrong. This is also called as **Reliability**.

- **Elasticity**: You can configure cloud-based apps to take advantage of autoscaling, so your apps always have the resources they need. It can decrease resource if they are underused or increase if demand is high.

- **Disaster recovery**: By taking advantage of cloud-based backup services, data replication, and geo-distribution, you can deploy your apps with the confidence that comes from knowing that your data is safe in the event of disaster.

### What are cloud service models?

There are 3 Cloud Service Models:

- **Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)** the cloud provider will keep the hardware up-to-date, but operating system maintenance and network configuration is up to you as the cloud tenant.

- **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)** the cloud provider manages the virtual machines and networking resources, and the cloud tenant deploys their applications into the managed hosting environment.

- **Software-as-a-Service(SaaS)** the cloud provider manages all aspects of the application environment, such as virtual machines, networking resources, data storage, and applications. The cloud tenant only needs to provide their data to the application managed by the cloud provider.

The following illustration demonstrates the services that might run in each of the cloud service models.

![](https://imgur.com/Ia6D7IM.png){: .full}

The following chart illustrates the various levels of responsibility between a cloud provider and a cloud tenant.

![](https://imgur.com/tCJ0p7V.png){: .full}

### What is serverless computing?

It is a PaaS model. Normally used by developers to build applications faster. With serverless applications, the cloud service provider automatically provisions, scales, and manages the infrastructure required to run the code. Serverless architectures are highly scalable and event-driven, only using resources when a specific function or trigger occurs.

{: .notice--success}
üèÜ **Pro Tip** \
\
The "serverless" name comes from the fact that the tasks associated with infrastructure provisioning and management are invisible to the developer. This approach enables developers to increase their focus on the business logic, and deliver more value to the core of the business.

### What are public, private, and hybrid clouds?

There are three deployment models:

- **Public cloud** is cloud resources, such as servers and storage, are `owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider`, and delivered over the internet.

- **Private cloud** consists of computing resources used exclusively by `users from one business or organization`. A private cloud can be physically located at your organization's on-site (on-premises) datacenter, or it can be hosted by a third-party service provider.

- **Hybrid cloud** is a computing environment that combines a `public cloud and a private cloud` by allowing data and applications to be shared between them.

## How Azure Works?

![](https://i.imgur.com/S2EB0iV.png){: .full}

Azure works with technology called **Virtualization**. Means separates the tight coupling between Hardware and its operating system.

![](https://i.imgur.com/n2HRQdJ.png){: .full}

It uses **Hypervisor** to abstract away the coupling between hardware & software using Virtualization technique.

![](https://i.imgur.com/xS7cXdH.png){: .full}

Azure has lots of Data Centers in many regions spread around the world. Azure uses virtualization in massive scale in all of its data-centers.

**Data-center** has **Rack** and Rack has servers. Each server includes Hypervisor.

There is **Network Switch** which allows connectivity to all of the servers.

![](https://i.imgur.com/2urDTsz.png){: .full}

**One server** in the rack runs special software called as **Fabric Controller**.

![](https://i.imgur.com/Y32nDX0.png){: .full}

Azure Fabric Controller is connected to **ORCHESTRATOR** software. An Orchestrator responds to user requests.

{: .notice--success}
üèÜ **Pro Tip** \
\
In-fact **Azure Orchestrator** manages everything that happens in Azure. Like it can package the Virtual Machine request coming from user and send to Azure Fabric Controller to create it.

![](https://i.imgur.com/TfOkyJV.png){: .full}

The users can make requests using the **Orchestrators Web API**.

![](https://i.imgur.com/o3Ol9NR.png){: .full}

The **Web API** can be called using **Azure Portal** and many tools.

![](https://i.imgur.com/tDjFTKJ.png){: .full}

**For example**, when a user makes a request to create a Virtual Machine (VM) from Azure portal. The Orchestrator packages everything needed and chooses the best server Rack. And then sends the package and request to the Fabric Controller. Once the Fabric Controller has created the Virtual Machine, the user can connect to it.

## Get started with Azure accounts

### What is the Azure account?

To create and use Azure services, you need an Azure subscription. When you create an **Azure account** then Azure subscription will be created automatically for you. You're free to create additional subscriptions. Next, you can start creating Azure resources within each subscription.

![](https://imgur.com/H2tQko7.png){: .full}

![](https://imgur.com/jEoLDBr.png){: .full}

{: .notice--success}
üèÜ **Pro Tip** \
\
You **don't need to purchase an Azure account** before you can use any Azure resources. Because, You can use a free Azure account or a Microsoft Learn sandbox to create resources.

![](https://imgur.com/fV0lcsb.png){: .full}

### What is the Azure free account?

The Azure free account includes:

- Free access to popular Azure `products` for `12 months`.
- A `credit` to spend for the `first 30 days`.
- Access to more than `25 products` that are `always free`.

### What is the Learn sandbox?

Maximum **Learn** exercises use a technology called the **sandbox**, which creates a `temporary subscription` that's added to your Azure account. Learn automatically cleans up the temporary resources for you after you've completed the module. The sandbox is the preferred method to use though, because it allows you to create and test Azure resources at no cost to you.

## Azure fundamentals facts

- Three cloud computing deployment models are public cloud, private cloud, and hybrid cloud.
- Cloud computing typically decreases your operating expenses.
- IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS are examples of cloud computing service models.
- Cloud computing resources are **NOT** usually limited to specific geographic regions.
