> When I was learning Azure Infrastructure, I had big question in my mind what is subnet and why do I need Subnet in my network? If you share my question then here is the article for you! Everything you must know about subnet as a beginner.

## What is Subnetting?

**Sub + Network** = **Subnet**.

You company has one Network that runs your company. You want to break the Network in to small pieces called as Sub Network which is Subnet.

You buy whole one pizza. However, you eat them in slices, so it is easier to you eat. So you divide you pizza into slices.

You have one whole network you divide them in smaller network. So that you can manage them easily and organize them better.

## Why do we need to Subnet a Network?

There are 3 main reasons, why you want to subnet a network:

1. Security üëÆ
2. Organization üèõÔ∏è
3. Performance üèÉ

### üëÆ Security

You have secure, high confidential data in network that you don't want them to be shared to anyone. It could be your top secrete company project. Your company employees personal records etc. Therefore, your network security is very important. And Subnetting to your network brings security to your Network.

### üèõÔ∏è Organization

You can take each subnet and assign to different department of your company. For example, you distribute your subnet among IT department, HR department, Sales team etc.

### üèÉ Performance

Since Subnet is small therefore, it give better performance.

How do we connect multiple subnets to each other? Answer is via [router](#router).

## Router

A router is a network device that connects different networks together. Each network is signified by it's network id or area code. You can use router to connect your subnets as well.<mark> Each subnet want to communicate to other subnet must go through the Router. </mark>. Router acts as a gateway and it has default gateway number for each subnet. So each [host](#host) within the subnet must send packet to the default gateway in order to communicate to other subnet or the internet. 

You can enforce policies and rules to restrict some subnet to communicate to other subnet in Router. For example, suppose you want Infrastructure Team subnet to restrict to communicate to Human Resource subnet you can do in your Router. So Router is a Single point of administration.

In this diagram, `Ken` & `Jim` can communicate to each other since they are in same subnet. `Ken`, `Jim` are also called as [host](#host). However, If `Ken` in left side subnet wants to send some data to `Ora` who is in right side subnet. Then Ken has to go through his default gateway which is the router. Router defines the default gateway for Ken and Jim is `192.0.2.1`. Similarly for `Ora`, the default gateway is `198.51.100.1`. So the packet will go from Ken to default Gateway then it will flow to the Ora device via her default gateway. Therefore, all communication across the subnet is happening via the router. Which is also connect to the Internet with the public facing IP address `203.0.113.42`.

Some time Router also has its own default gateway see below diagram.

ISP (Internet Service Provider) or Data Center has big router with lots of cable.

### Host

Host is a device with specified IP address within the network. It could be your smart phone with IP (192.0.2.104). Or your family member's iPad or laptop with unique IP address.
