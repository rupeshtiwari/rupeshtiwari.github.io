In [Nx Monorepo workspace](https://nx.dev/) you can have applications(apps) and libraries(libs).
Apps mostly have projects that are front-end applications hosted on the server.

However, Libs should have the projects which should supporting your applications.Inside the Libs folder you can have your service projects. Within the Libs folder you can end up creating lots of projects and it is very confusing when every project can depend on every other project.

However, If you want to partition service code into well-defined cohesive blocks. Especially if you are following Service Oriented Architecture [Advanced Distributed Systems Design by Udi Dahan](https://particular.net/adsd). Then you might be aware that one service code should not depend on another service code. Therefore, you want to impose constraints on how projects can depend on each other in JavaScript Projects. Then it is very difficult if you don't use any framework. I would highly recommend using [Nx Monorepo](https://nx.dev/) `tag` and `scope`.

## I have a project where I have Libraries

`Branding` folder that has couple of projects like `logger`, `layout`, `angular material`
`Sales` folder that has couple of projects `product-editor` and `products`
`Customers` folder that has couple of projects `user-editor` and `users`

## I want to enforce below rules by Nx Monorepo Framework

- Sales projects can depend on Branding projects
- Sales projects should not depend on Customers projects
- Customers projects can depend on Branding projects
- Customers projects should not depend on Sales projects
- Branding projects can not depend on Sales projects
- Branding projects can not depend on Customers projects

## Step1: Add Project's Tags in Nx.json

Go to `nx.json` and add projects tags.

```json
"projects": {
    "sales-product-editor": {
      "tags": [
        "scope:sales"
      ]
    },
    "sales-products": {
      "tags": [
        "scope:sales"
      ]
    },
    "customers-user-editor": {
      "tags": [
        "scope:customers"
      ]
    },
    "customers-users": {
      "tags": [
        "scope:customers"
      ]
    },
    "shared-ng-material": {
      "tags": [
        "scope:branding"
      ]
    },
    "shared-layout": {
      "tags": [
        "scope:branding"
      ]
    },
    "shared-logger": {
      "tags": [
        "scope:branding"
      ]
    },
     "onlinestore-client-e2e": {
      "tags": [],
      "implicitDependencies": [
        "onlinestore-client"
      ]
    },
    "onlinestore-admin-e2e": {
      "tags": [],
      "implicitDependencies": [
        "onlinestore-admin"
      ]
    },
       "onlinestore-client": {
      "tags": [
        "type:app",
        "scope:client"
      ]
    },
    "onlinestore-admin": {
      "tags": [
        "type:app",
        "scope:admin"
      ]
    },
    "onlinestore-client-e2e": {
      "tags": [],
      "implicitDependencies": [
        "onlinestore-client"
      ]
    },
    "onlinestore-admin-e2e": {
      "tags": [],
      "implicitDependencies": [
        "onlinestore-admin"
      ]
    }
  }
```

## Step2: Add Enforcements in tslint.json file

Add below `nx-enforce-module-boundaries` array in `tslint.json` file.

```json
 "nx-enforce-module-boundaries": [
      true,
      {
        "enforceBuildableLibDependency": true,
        "allow": [],
        "depConstraints": [
          {
            "sourceTag": "scope:sales",
            "onlyDependOnLibsWithTags": [
              "scope:sales",
              "scope:branding"
            ]
          },
          {
            "sourceTag": "scope:customers",
            "onlyDependOnLibsWithTags": [
              "scope:customers",
              "scope:branding"
            ]
          },
          {
            "sourceTag": "scope:branding",
            "onlyDependOnLibsWithTags": [
              "scope:branding"
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
```

## Test the boundary constraint

Now if you go to `sales-products.module.ts` and perform below imports.

Remember the Rule for Sales Service: :+1:

- Sales projects can depend on Branding projects
- Sales projects can depend on other Sales projects
- Sales projects should not depend on Customers projects

### Lets Test the Sales Service boundary.

- 1.  Try to import `SharedLoggerModule` from branding scope and run `npm run affected:lint` you will _not_ see any error.

```ts
// sales project
import { SharedLoggerModule } from '@myorg/shared/logger';
```

- 2.  Try to import `CustomersUserEditorModule` from Customers scope and run `npm run affected:lint` you _will_ see any error.

```ts
// Sales project can not depend on Customers project
import { CustomersUserEditorModule } from '@myorg/customers-user-editor';
```

You will see below error:

```error
> ng run sales-products:lint
Linting "sales-products"...
C:/Projects/GitHub/nx-repo/myorg/myorg/libs/sales/products/src/lib/sales-products.module.ts:9:1
ERROR: 9:1  nx-enforce-module-boundaries  A project tagged
with "scope:sales" can only depend on libs tagged with "scope:sales", "scope:branding"
```

- 3.  Try to import `SalesProductEditorModule` Project from sales service only and and run `npm run affected:lint` you will _not_ see any error.

```ts
// Sales project can depend on other sales project
import { SalesProductEditorModule } from '@myorg/sales-product-editor';
```

## Conclusion

So I loved the way Nx Monorepo framework gives the boundary constraints out of the box.
