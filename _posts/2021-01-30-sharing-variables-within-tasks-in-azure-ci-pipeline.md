Do you want to create one variable in task-1 and read the value of that variable
in task-2 in your azure ci pipeline? If your answer is yes then read this
article.

I will show you how to get
[new build number from node.js](https://hackmd.io/QiDKOk2RTKee1Y822ceSYA). Then
we will use the new build number in another task to update the azure pipeline
build number.

## azure devops setvariable task

We will write expression to run inbuilt task from azure pipeline to set new
variable. When we run `script` from azure pipeline then basically it is a
command line script you are running in windows command prompt.
`echo '##vso[task.setvariable variable=one]secondValue'`

```yml=
- steps
 - script : |
     echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=name]Rupesh"

 - script : echo "My Name is $(name)"  # it will print Rupesh
```

Notice we are using
[Macro Syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml%2Cbatch#macro-syntax-variables)
to access the variable `name`. :bulb: Notice I have read the variable `name` in
next task. If I would read the variable on the first task it will print empty.
So any task that assigns pipeline variables those are only accessible in next
task onwards only.

## Creating Pipeline Variable in Azure pipeline Task

Lets create `newBuildNumber` variable that we are getting from node.js script.

:bulb: As we know when you create a pipeline level variable in a task then
within the same task you will not be able to access that pipeline variable
within same task. Therefore, always when you create a pipeline variable then try
to always create new task to read that variable and do other task. Therefore, we
are printing the value using task scoped variable `$num` on "Create New
Variable" task.

In below example I am using build.js file to get new build number. Read
"[Calling Node.js Script from Azure Devops CI Pipeline](https://hackmd.io/QiDKOk2RTKee1Y822ceSYA)"
to know how am I returning build id from build.js file.

Create below task and note we are using `setvariable` task to create
`newBuildNumber` variable.

```yaml=
- script: |
    echo "old buildnumber ~>$(Build.BuildNumber)"
    export num=$(node ./build.js $(Build.BuildId) $(Build.SourceBranchName))
    echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=newBuildNumber]$num"
    echo "Created new variable 'newBuildNumber' with value $num"
  displayName: 'Creating New Variable'
  enabled: true
```

## Accessing Pipeline Variable in Azure pipeline Task

:bulb: Remember when you are accessing a pipeline variable that is shared across
task then you must use
[Macro Syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml%2Cbatch#macro-syntax-variables)
means $(newBuildNumber).

In this example I am using `$(newBuildNumber)` to access/read pipeline scoped
`newBuildNumber` variable created from previous task.

We are updating the build number of the azure pipeline.

```yaml=
- script: |
    echo "Accessing NewBuild Number Variable $(newBuildNumber) & Updating Build Number of Pipeline"
    echo "##vso[build.updatebuildnumber]$(newBuildNumber)"
  displayName: 'Update Build Number'
  enabled: true
```

## Displaying new Build number of azure pipeline

In order to display updated build number I will use `Build.BuildNumber`

```yaml=
- script:  echo "new buildnumber ~>$(Build.BuildNumber)"
  displayName: 'Display New Build Number'
  enabled: true
```
