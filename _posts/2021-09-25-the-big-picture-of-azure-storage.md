- It is an **object storage** solution
- **Unstructured data** can be stored
- 3 types of blobs: block,append and page
- files, documents, binary data like image, video, audio files, databases and disks can be stored in blob storage.

### Azure Files

- Similar to Azure Blob it can store **unstructured data**.
- **Any type** of file
- Support **SMB protocol**
- **Attach** file share **to VM** just like network share
- Application which can not talk to blob api and need Network file share then you can use Azure files to access files on network.
- File share can be connect to on-premise computer

### Azure Tables

- **Structured** data only
- Data broke down into Fields
- NoSQL database for fast read and write
- You could use SQL database also

#### Cosmos DB

**Cosmos DB** is another **service** for Azure Table. - NoSQL database - built-in feature to distributing your app globally. - However, storage account specific to region and region pair. So cosmos DB is more reliable. - built-in strategy to migrate Azure Table to cosmos db.

### Azure Queues

- Store & retrieve **messages**
- Asynchronous reliable
- good for **microservices**

#### Azure Service Bus

There is another **service** for **Azure Queues** called **Azure Service Bus**

### Azure Disks

- It is used by VMs
- They are stored as type of Page Blob
- You can upload your own VMs disk using PowerShell or Portal.

## Accessible

Azure CLI, Azure storage Explorer, Azure portal, AZ copy, Powershell and program everyone can use **REST API** to access all data. All of the data are exposed to REST endpoint.

## Security

You can limit who can access your data. You can encrypt by your own encryption keys for **blobs and files** services by uploading on Azure Key Vault. By default Microsoft put all data encrypted at rest.

## Durable and highly available

Azure stores 3 copies of data in the data-center that you will choose. You can failover to other redundant data storage at anytime.

## Storage Capacity

Per Azure Storage Account you can store 5 PiB of data including blob, files, queues, disk, tables etc. You can create multiple accounts.

### Pricing
