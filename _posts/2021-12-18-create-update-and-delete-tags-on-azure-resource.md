> Learn more about how to use tags to organize your Azure resources and management hierarchy. Also learn the `cmdlet` used to fetch tags from Azure resources.

## What is Tag in Azure Resources?

- You apply tags to your **Azure resources, resource groups, and subscriptions** to `logically` organize them into a `taxonomy`.
- Each tag consists of a **name and a value pair**. For example, you can create tag and apply the name "Environment" and the value "Stage" to all the resources in stage. Learn more about [Tagging ideas](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/tag-resources)
- **Tag names are case-insensitive**: Example: "Environment" or "environment" they are same tag names.
- **Tag values are case-sensitive**: Example: "Stage" or "stage" they are different tag values.

```powershell
Get-AzResource # To fetch  all resources
```

## Apply tags to Azure Resource

{% include video id="QTDDL8_0N3c" provider="youtube" %}

Use `New-AzTag` to apply tag on resource in **Azure**.

```powershell
# Create Tag variable
$tags = @{"Dept"="Finance"; "Status"="Normal"}
# Get the resource that you want to appply tag on.
$resource = Get-AzResource -Name "Application Insights Smart Detection" -ResourceGroup AdmissionApplication
# Apply Tag
New-AzTag -ResourceId $resource.id -Tag $tags
```

## View Tag on Azure Resource

{% include video id="QTDDL8_0N3c" provider="youtube" %}
Use `Get-AzTag` cmdlet to view tag on Azure resource. You have to pass the resource Id though. You can also use `Get-AzResource` cmdlet to view the tags directly under a perticular resource.

```powershell
# Get the resource that you want to view tag on.
$resource = Get-AzResource -Name "Application Insights Smart Detection" -ResourceGroup AdmissionApplicationGet-AzTag -ResourceId   $resource.id
# View tags
Get-AzTag -ResourceId   $resource.id
```

## Delete Tag on a Azure Resource

{% include video id="2211KACFlmw" provider="youtube" %}
To remove specific tags, use **Update-AzTag** and set **-Operation** to **Delete**. Pass in the tags you want to delete.

```powershell
# Get the resource that you want to view tag on.
$resource = Get-AzResource -Name "Application Insights Smart Detection" -ResourceGroup AdmissionApplication
# View tags
Get-AzTag -ResourceId $resource.id
# Decide which tags to remove
$removeTags = @{"Dept"="Finance"; "Status"="Normal"}
# Delete the tags
Update-AzTag -ResourceId $resource.id -Tag $removeTags -Operation Delete
# Confirm Tags are deleted by fetching them again
Get-AzTag -ResourceId $resource.id
```

## Delete Tag on a Azure Subscription

{% include video id="2211KACFlmw" provider="youtube" %}
To remove all tags from your Azure subscription, use the [Remove-AzTag](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/az.resources/remove-aztag) command.

```powershell
# Get subscription by it's name
$subscription = (Get-AzSubscription -SubscriptionName   "Example Subscription").Id
# Remove the tags
Remove-AzTag -ResourceId "/subscriptions/$subscription"

```

## Merge Tag

{% include video id="8vtnn1ZacNg" provider="youtube" %}

```powershell
$tags = @{"Location"="Canada"}
# Merge Tag
Update-AzTag -ResourceId $resource.id -Tag $tags -Operation Merge
```

## Replace Tag

{% include video id="0GJ27K3CWXA" provider="youtube" %}

```powershell
$tags = @{"Dept"="Sales"; "Status"="High"}
# Replace tags
Update-AzTag -ResourceId $resource.id -Tag $tags -Operation Replace
```
