> Do you want to **build** your first **Angular App** and **deploy** over cloud using **GitHub Actions**? How to deploy/publish Angular App to GitHub Pages automatically? Did you use **GitHub Actions** to **build** and **deploy** **Angular** App over **GitHub Pages**? Stay tuned in this article I will show you step by step from creating angular app to building and deploying using **GitHub Actions**.

## What are we building

We will build an angular application & deploy over [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Creating an Angular Application

Run Below script to create new angular app.

`ng new sample-app`

### Install Npm package

 `ng add angular-cli-ghpages` 

## What are the steps on Build

- ‚úîÔ∏è Build
- ‚úîÔ∏è Lint
- ‚úîÔ∏è Test

## Creating GitHub Actions

Let's create GitHub workflow with jobs. Note that now a days GitHub actions runner sets the `CI=true` by default. [Learn more here](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-04-15-github-actions-sets-the-ci-environment-variable-to-true/)...

### Name of Workflow

```yaml
name: Angular GitHub CI # üëà
```

### Trigger on Main Branch

Let's trigger the job whenever `main` branch got new push.

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main # üëà
```

### Node Versions

Let's run on multiple node versions on `ubuntu-latest`.

```yaml
jobs:
  ci:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [10.x, 12.x]
        # üëÜ
```

Note we are using `node10` and `node12`/ Therefore, at a time there will be parallelly 2 jobs will run one for 10.x and one for `12.x`

### Checkout source code

Let's checkout the code first.

```yaml
steps:
  - uses:
      actions/checkout@v2
      # üëÜ
```

### Setup Node Environment

```yaml
- name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
- uses: actions/setup-node@v1
  with:
    node-version:
      ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      # üëÜ
```

### Use GitHub Cache

Let's use GitHub Cache to save `node_modules`. Learn more about [Caching GitHub Workflow dependencies here](https://www.rupeshtiwari.com/caching-dependencies-on-github-workflows).

{% gist 81a8c36affe7ed445b78941a1070996d %}

### Install Dependencies

Next we must install node packages conditionally. [Learn more here](https://www.rupeshtiwari.com/caching-dependencies-on-github-workflows)...

```yaml
- name: Install Dependencies
  if:
    steps.cache-nodemodules.outputs.cache-hit != 'true'
    # üëÜ if cache hits the skip this step.
  run: npm ci
```

### Building Project

Let's run build in `production mode` to compile our project. We need to pass `-- --prod` so that `ng build --prod` will be executed.

```yaml
- name: Build
  run: npm run build -- --prod
```

### Linting Project

Let's run linting.

```yaml
- name: Lint
  run: npm run lint
```

### Testing Project

Let's run test in production mode. We need to make sure while running Test:

- ‚úîÔ∏è we are using **chrome headless browser** `"browsers": "ChromeHeadless"` and
- ‚úîÔ∏è Generating code coverage `"codeCoverage": true,`
- ‚úîÔ∏è Ignoring Source Map `"sourceMap": false`
- üëÅÔ∏è Make sure not in watch mode ` "watch": false`

All of the above settings can be done in `angular.json` file.

Navigate to `angular.json` file identify project name.

1. Go to test object. `projects.sample-app.architect.test`
2. Add below code configuration for production.

```json
"configurations": {
  "production": {
    "sourceMap": false,
    "codeCoverage": true,
    "browsers": "ChromeHeadless",
    "watch": false
  }
},
```

It will look like this:
```json
       "test": {
          "builder": "@angular-devkit/build-angular:karma",
          "configurations": { üëà
            "production": {
              "sourceMap": false,
              "codeCoverage": true,
              "browsers": "ChromeHeadless",
              "watch": false
            }
          },üëà
          "options": {
            "main": "src/test.ts",
            "polyfills": "src/polyfills.ts",
            "tsConfig": "tsconfig.spec.json",
            "karmaConfig": "karma.conf.js",
            "assets": [
              "src/favicon.ico",
              "src/assets"
            ],
            "styles": [
              "src/styles.scss"
            ],
            "scripts": []
          }
        },
```

Lets add below script in the `main.yml` file. Which will use above production test configuration while running in build machine.

```yaml
- name: Test
  run: npm run test -- --prod
```

### Triggering GitHub Workflow

Now is the time to see our workflow in action. Go ahead and push the changes to GitHub and check your actions tab on github.

Notice both jobs are completed:

### Complete YAML file

## Deploying Angular App to GitHub Pages

Next once you know your project is passing all these below steps under `CI` job.

- ‚úîÔ∏è Build
- ‚úîÔ∏è Lint
- ‚úîÔ∏è Test

Next we must deploy the app to somewhere. In this example I will deploy our app to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

### GitHub Pages

**GitHub Pages** are free where you can host your static site. I am going explain you the steps to deploy your angular app there.

### Using Ng Deploy

`ng deploy` is the **Angular CLI command** that automates the deployment of Angular App to **GitHub Pages**. When you run `ng deploy`, it executes a builder that performs the deployment for you.

Install [`angular-cli-ghpages`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-cli-ghpages) builder by Running script `ng add angular-cli-ghpages` on command line from root of your project.

### Deploying to GitHub Pages From Local machine

In GitHub Page server we must give `base-href` to our `repository name` so that It can host our static files successfully. Since our GitHub repository name is `angular-ci-cd-with-github-actions` my deploy script would be: `ng deploy --base-href=/angular-ci-cd-with-github-actions/`

Add below script on `package.json`

```shell
    "deploy": "ng deploy --base-href=/angular-ci-cd-with-github-actions/"
```

You can even run the deploy command from local machine to test `npm run deploy`

### Your App is Live on GitHubPage

Go to the settings of your GitHub Repository and notice the Site is published. Wait for 2-5 mins and then browse your app.

Notice our site is up and running on GitHub Pages

## Update GitHub Actions to Deploy Angular App

Next let's update the workflow to deploy our app over GitHub Pages. Below 2 steps we will run whenever previous steps are passing. Note that that `if: success()` is always implied unless you specify `if: always()` or `if: failure()` . Therefore, I am not adding if condition in my steps.

### Creating Change Log

Add secret called as `TOKEN_GITHUB_ACTION` to your repository.

![](https://imgur.com/tQNt59s.png)

Next we will use [Conventional ChangeLog Action](https://github.com/TriPSs/conventional-changelog-action) to create our change log.

{% gist ae8a69e9004fd19773e1cdfbf9dad768 %}

```yaml
- name: Conventional Changelog Action
  id: changelog
  uses: TriPSs/conventional-changelog-action@v3
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.TOKEN_GITHUB_ACTION }}
    output-file: 'false'
```

### Creating GitHub Release

Next we will use [Conventional ChangeLog Action](https://github.com/TriPSs/conventional-changelog-action) to tag our repo and create GitHub Release. Note: If you have no changes then this will **not** create a **release**.

{% gist 432995b8ead5171de82e2623f446b60f %}

### Deploy to GitHub Pages

Finally let's deploy the app to GitHub Pages.

```yaml
- name: Deploy
  run: |
    npm run deploy
```

### Complete YAML for deploying angular app to GitHub-Pages

Here is my [final workflow](https://gist.github.com/rupeshtiwari/9f252dc665656c434c4d50a70519f9ac):
{% gist 9f252dc665656c434c4d50a70519f9ac %}

Now if you push the changes workflow will trigger and CI/CD will succeed üÜí!
