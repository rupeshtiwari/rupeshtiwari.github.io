Suppose you have Google Cloud (GCS), Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Azure and you wan to write a configuration file to manage the workflow of each cloud infrastructure. It is possible via [HashiCorp Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

## HashiCorp Terraform

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that provides a consistent CLI workflow to manage hundreds of cloud services. Terraform codifies cloud APIs into declarative configuration files. It is an open-source tool for provisioning and managing cloud infrastructure that codifies infrastructure in configuration files that describe the topology of cloud resources

## You can Write Infrastructure Code

Write infrastructure as code using declarative configuration files. HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) allows for concise descriptions of resources using blocks, arguments, and expressions.

## Plan before execution

Run terraform plan to check whether the execution plan for a configuration matches your expectations before provisioning or changing infrastructure.

## Apply Multiple Cloud Services
