If you are following agile then continuous integration is must. I have setup
CI/CD in Azure DevOps and I personally found my **Angular** build is taking lot
of time. The npm install step itself takes like around 3 minutes or so to
download all **node_modules** files. If you are using
[nrwl.Nx monorepo](https://nx.dev/) then you will notice your `npm install` or
`npm ci` step will take around 8 to 10 minutes. Every-time you push the build it
will download all of the node packages from npm.org and will spend same amount
of time even-though you have not changed their versions. That is waste of time
and resources.

Fortunately, Azure DevOps now offers a new build task called
[cache task](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/release/caching?view=azure-devops)
(Pipeline Caching). In this article I will give you steps to create a Build
Definition by using Cache Task. I will demonstrate how you can speedup your
build process more than 50% or so.

## Create Node.js Project

After restoring from cache during build time. If I use the node package to run
some program it should work lets test it.

add build script in package.json `build: node index.js`

index.js

```json=
const chalk = require('chalk');

console.log(chalk.blue('Hello world!'));
```

## How to know cache location in Azure DevOps.

Check the log of `npm install` or `npm ci`

In my case it says `D:\\a\\.npm` which means it is `$(Pipeline.Workspace)/.npm`
in azure devops machine.

In this example it says cache location is `C:\\npm\\cache`

## First Npm Ci 20s

## Second Time Npm Ci <1s

After first time build if you do not change package-lock.json file and rebuild
then your build should be super fast even less than a second.

## Steps to create Azure Devops CI Build Definition with Cache

Create new pipeline and select classic editor and start adding task as mentioned
below.

### step 1: Add Cache Task

Pipeline caching can help reduce build time by allowing the outputs or
downloaded dependencies from one run to be reused in later runs, thereby
reducing or avoiding the cost to recreate or re-download the same files again.

```
name: Cache npm Dependencies
key: **/package-lock.json, !**/node_modules/**/package-lock.json, !**/.*/**/package-lock.json
path:$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/node_modules
```

### step 2: Add npm task for ci

select `ci`

Inside Control options:

- set enabled
- Run this task: Select Custom Condition
- Add `eq(variables['CacheRestored'],False)` in Custom Condition Text.

### step 3: Add npm task for build

Add new npm task and call it `npm build` Add your build script from your
package.json

## Build Definition

```yaml
pool:
  name: Azure Pipelines
  demands: npm

steps:
  - task: Cache@2
    displayName: "Cache npm Dependencies"
    inputs:
      key:
        "**/package-lock.json, !**/node_modules/**/package-lock.json,
        !**/.*/**/package-lock.json"
      path: "$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/node_modules"
      cacheHitVar: CacheRestored

  - task: Npm@1
    displayName: "npm ci"
    inputs:
      command: ci
      verbose: false
    condition: eq(variables['CacheRestored'],False)

  - task: Npm@1
    displayName: "npm build"
    inputs:
      command: custom
      verbose: false
      customCommand: "run build"
```
