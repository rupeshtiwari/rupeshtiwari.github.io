`Yaml` files are used in Azure Pipelines for build and release definition. Yaml
files are also used in GitHub build and release. Yaml is designed to be clean
and easy to read.

## File Format

.yml or .yaml

## How to comment?

`# comment`

## Define info about person

The writer        has no idea what topic the random paragraph will be about when it            appears.This forces the writer to use creativity to complete one              of three common writing challenges.

# values to render in single line
