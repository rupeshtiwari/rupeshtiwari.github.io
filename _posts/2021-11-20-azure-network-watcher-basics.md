> Azure Network Watcher is a **monitoring service** with lots of other important services for network. **Most network diagnostics issues can be detected and analyzed with Azure Network Watcher**. Learn everything about Network Watcher in this article.

## What Network Watcher Does?

- You use Network Watcher to monitor and repair the network health of IaaS (Infrastructure as Service) resources.
- It can capture network packets by sniffing the network
- It can analyze and display the network topology
- It can audit the security rules of network and VMs.
- It is a regional service
- It is automatically enabled in a region when you create or update a virtual network (vNet) in it.

## Capabilities of Network Watcher

### Monitoring

- Network Watcher can monitor communication between a VM and another endpoint (could be VM).
- Network Watcher can view resources in a virtual network.

### Diagnostics

- It can diagnose network traffic filtering problems to or from a VM.
- It can diagnose network routing problems from a VM.
- It can diagnose outbound connections from a VM.
- It can capture packets to and from VM.
- It can determine relative latencies between Azure regions and Internet Service Providers (ISPs).
- It can show security rules for an interface like network interface for a VM.

### Metrics and Logs

- It can analyze network security groups traffic.
- It can show diagnostics logs for network resources.

You can monitor the topology of your virtual network and you can click on any component to view them.

### Connection Monitor

Connection Monitor monitors the health of the connections between 2 endpoints could be 2 virtual networks or 2 VMs.

### Next hop

This will give you the next network hop from a given source IP address to a destination IP address. You can use this to troubleshoot the issues.

Example: Source IP address could be your VM in azure and destination IP address could be your local home machine IP address.

So in this example the next hop is Internet.

### Effective Security Rules

Check security settings of your IaaS. Example: Check the security settings for your VM in Azure.

### Packet capture
