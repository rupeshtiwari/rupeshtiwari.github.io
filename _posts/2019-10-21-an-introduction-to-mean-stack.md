<p>MEAN is an acronym for <strong>MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS and Node.js.</strong> From client to server to database, MEAN is full stack JavaScript framework, ideal for building dynamic websites and applications. It is a free and open-source stack designed to supply developers with a quick and organized method for creating MEAN-based web applications. One of the main benefits of the MEAN stack is that a single primitive language - JavaScript, runs on every level of the application, making it an efficient, advanced and modern approach to web development.  The term MEAN stack refers to a collection of <strong>JavaScript based technologies</strong> used to develop web applications. Technologies covered are:</p>

<p><strong>MongoDB</strong> is a schemaless NoSQL database system. It saves data in binary JSON format which makes it easier to pass data between client and server. It provides high performance, high availability, and easy scalability because it is a cross-platform, document-oriented database.</p>
<p><strong>ExpressJS</strong> is lightweight framework used to build web applications in Node. It is inspired by the popular Ruby framework, Sinatra. It provides a number of robust features for building single and multi page web application.</p>
<p><strong> AngularJS</strong> is a JavaScript framework developed by Google. It provides some advanced features like the two-way data binding and Dependency Injection. It’s a complete solution for rapid and modern front end development.</p>
<p><strong>Node.JS</strong> is a server side JavaScript execution environment. It helps in building highly scalable and concurrent applications quickly by using event-driven, on-blocking I/O model. It is a cross-platform runtime environment.</p>
