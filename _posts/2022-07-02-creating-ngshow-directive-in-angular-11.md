description: Are you wondering how to use ng-show in Angular 11? There is a way to achieve it by using [hidden]= ‚Äúfalse‚Äù. However, if you are migrating large angularjs projects into angular 11 then it is really tedious and error prone work to convert them into [hidden]="" expression format. Also you have to negate all existing logic to show the element while using hidden. In this article I will explain how you can create your own ngShow directive in Angular 11.

> Are you wondering how to use `ng-show` in Angular 11? There is a way to achieve it by using `[hidden]= ‚Äúfalse‚Äù`. However, if you are migrating large `angularjs` projects into `angular 11` then it is really tedious and error prone work to convert them into `[hidden]=""` expression format. Also you have to negate all existing logic to show the element while using `hidden`. In this article I will explain how you can create your own `ngShow` directive in Angular 11.

So basically we are saying we want to replace below angular js code

```html
<div ng-show="‚Äùvm.canShow()‚Äù"></div>
```

With Angular 11 style code like:

```html
<div [ngShow]="‚ÄùcanShow()‚Äù"></div>
```

Since the `ng-show` directive is going to be used in various modules in your project. Therefore, I have decided to put this directive in a shared module.

Let‚Äôs create one shared module in angular and create a `ng-show.directive.ts` file.

## Creating ngShow directive in Angular 11

Add below code in `ng-show.directive.ts`

````ts
import { Directive, ElementRef, Input } from '@angular/core';

/**
 * ## Example
 * ```html
 * <button [ngShow]="show">Create</button>
 * ```
 * ```ts
 * get show() {
 *   return false; // it will hide button. If you pass `true` it will show button.
 * }
 * ```
 */
@Directive({
  selector: '[ngShow]',
})
export class NgShowDirective {
  constructor(private ngEl: ElementRef) {}

  @Input()
  set ngShow(condition: boolean) {
    this.show(condition);
  }

  private show(value: boolean): void {
    this.ngEl.nativeElement.style.display = value ? '' : 'none';
  }
}
````

That's it. Next let me show how this can be used in App Module.

## How to use NgShow in Angular 11

### Step 1: Import the `shared module` in `AppModule`

```ts
@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule, SharedModule],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

### Step 2: Use the `ngShow` directive.

```html
<div [ngShow]="show">
  <h2>We have created custom `ngShow` directive to show hide this text.</h2>
</div>
```

```ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
})
export class AppComponent {
  show = true;
}
```
