> Learn Merge Sorting algorithm in recursion function. In this article I will show you the execution of the recursion function for `Merge Sorting`.

## Merge sort

Merge sort is one of the most powerful sorting algorithm. Mozilla, Firefox, Chrome and many browser by default most of the time uses `Merge Sort` for sorting an array. You should learn `Merge sort` algorithm.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time complexity** = `O(nlogn)`
- **Space complexity** = `O(n)`

## Merge Sort Implementation Coding

- Here is the [exercise file](https://codepen.io/roopkt/pen/ExWRRgP?editors=0010) for you to implement merge sort. First try by your own.
- Here is the [answer file](https://codepen.io/roopkt/pen/ZEeMPPL) for merge sort `un-optimized` version.
- Here is the [answer file](https://codepen.io/roopkt/pen/yLMQvbv?editors=0010) for merge sort space `optimized` `in-place` array sorting.

Merge sort algorithm code shared in gist also.

## Step by Step explanation for Recursive Merge Sort Algorithm

First `main` function will call the `mergeSort` with entire given array.

![](https://i.imgur.com/JsR9WiT.png){: .full}

1st Recursion call to `mergeSort` with left part of the array `[2,4,1,6]` and pause the function execution at line `number-7`.

![](https://i.imgur.com/hHS3xNl.png){: .full}

2nd recursion call with Array `[2, 4]` and pervious function pauses at line `number -7`.

![](https://i.imgur.com/phJfnSY.png){: .full}

3rd recursion call with array `[2]` and previous function pauses at line `number-7`

![](https://i.imgur.com/eIa9tQY.png){: .full}

Resume 2nd recursion call with array `[2,4]` and call merge sort with right part `[4]`

![](https://i.imgur.com/E4lHVoS.png){: .full}

3rd recursion call with array `[4]` and previous function pauses at line `number -8`. This function will exit since length is `less than 2`.

![](https://i.imgur.com/BPGqO9K.png){: .full}

Therefore, 3rd recursion call resumes and executes at line `number-9`.

![](https://i.imgur.com/qRlvs1g.png){: .full}

Which is a call to `stitch` method which will join both left and right array and `re-order` them in `ascending` order.

![](https://i.imgur.com/cinoEQX.png){: .full}

Resume 2nd recursion method at line `number-7` and call `mergeSort` with right part of the array `[1,6]`.

![](https://i.imgur.com/EDo7OuL.png){: .full}

Pause the function at line `numnber-7` and call `mergeSort` with `[1]` which will exit because of base condition.

![](https://i.imgur.com/crHGUQM.png){: .full}

Function resume at line `numnber-7` and execute line `number-8` call `mergeSort` with `[6]`

![](https://i.imgur.com/CqbyltH.png){: .full}

`mergeSort` with `[6]` will exit because of base condition.

![](https://i.imgur.com/gBGkjOw.png){. full}

Next Resume 1st recursion at line `number-7` and execute `mergeSort` with `[8,5,3,7]`. Next function will pause at line `number-7` and will call `mergeSort` recursively with `[8,5]`.

![](https://i.imgur.com/C3dDwAe.png){: .full}

Next first it will make `mergeSort` with [8] and pause at line `number-7`.

![](https://i.imgur.com/tgRaKe4.png){: .full}

Next It will pause the previous function at line `number-7`. And Resume at line `number-7` and call `mergeSort` recursively and pause again at line `number-8` with `[5]` which will exit. Therefore, function will resume at line `number-8` and execute `stitch` to sort the array. Hence the array will become `[5,8]` and exit the function. The previous function resumes at line `number-7` and call `mergeSort` recursively with `[3,7]` and pauses at line `number-9`.

![](https://i.imgur.com/jr2jbo4.png){: .full}

Next it will call `mergeSort` with `[3]` recursively then pause at line `number-7`. `mergeSort` with `[3]` will exit and then previous function will resume again at `number-7` and execute next line which will call call `mergeSort` with `[7]` recursively then pause at line `number-8`. `mergeSort` with `[7]` exits and then previous function will resume again at `number-8` and execute next line `stitch` function that will sort the array to `[3,7]` and exit.

![](https://i.imgur.com/kZ1hvzE.png){: .full}

Finally The 1st function will resume at line `number-8` and call `stitch` method to re-order the array `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]` and finally exit.
This way you get the sorted array.

Sorting is done! however let me explain you the stitch algorithm which is the core part or merge sort.

## Merge sort Stich algorithm

You might have noticed that `MergeSort` Method is calling stitch at every recursion method. Now I will explain the `stitch` function to you. This is the algorithm that takes `left`, `right` and original array. Then it will re-order the original array in ascending order.

Here is the `stitch` algorithm code used for `merge` sort.

{% gist 1de701d2a201dda405ea701ab0030d5b%}

First compare left with right array 1st element. 1 is less than 3 so copy 1 at `A[0]`.

![](https://i.imgur.com/QgcDEkf.png){: .full}

Next compare 2 in left array with 3 in Right array. Since 2 is less than 3. Copy 2 at `A[1]`. Increment left and A array indices.

![](https://imgur.com/EVK7a8N.png){: .full}

Next compare 4 in left array with 3 in right array and since 4 is more than 3. Copy 4 to `A[2]` and increment A and R array indices.

![](https://i.imgur.com/HyNtQhv.png){: .full}

Next compare `4` in left array with `5` in Right array. Since `4` is less than `5`. Copy `4` at `A[3]`. Increment `left` and `A` array indices.

![](https://i.imgur.com/D40d5Ti.png){: .full}

Next compare `6` in left array with `5` in right array and since `6` is more than `5`. Copy `5` to `A[4]` and increment A and R array indices.

![](https://i.imgur.com/5sn4Kvx.png){: .full}

Next iterate over `left` array and copy remaining elements at Array `A` and increment both indices.

![](https://i.imgur.com/TwgMpfB.png){: .full}

Finally, iterate over `right` array and copy remaining elements at Array `A` and increment both indices.
