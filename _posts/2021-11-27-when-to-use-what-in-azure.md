> Learn what service from Azure you should use while creating your application in Azure. This article has quick short answer for when to use what in Azure service? Get [free e-book on Design Distributed Systems](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/designing-distributed-systems/).

## Running Application in Azure Options

### Virtual Machines (VMs)

![](https://imgur.com/lVMTAlR.png){: .full}

{: .notice--info}
游누 **Note** \
\
`Azure Virtual Machines` is under **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** offering from Microsoft Azure.

- Managed Virtual Machine Service in Cloud
- Starts and Stops in `minutes`
- Many OS images are available.
  - You can choose your own OS image (Linux Windows). Explore the full list of [Azure VM types](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-machines/series/)
  - You can bring your own OS /Software License ( same money )
- Many Sizes to choose from (CPU, Memory, Disk Type)
  - `General purpose`
  - `GPU` (for Intense work like video rendering etc.)
- Configuration options
  - Auto shutdown, Adding Disks, Adding VM to Networking
- SLA `99.95%` (Only if you run multiple instances)

{: .notice--success}
Link for [Getting Started with Azure Virtual Machine](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/). To get guarantied 99.95% SLA you must need 2 or more VMs.

### Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

{: .notice--info}
游누 **Note** \
\
`Azure Kubernetes Service` is under **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** offering from Microsoft Azure.

- Run `multiple` containers that makeup your applications
- Starts and stops in `seconds`
- Managed version of the Kubernetes container `orchestrator`. It takes care of provisioning or de-provisioning the containers. It scales up and down and monitor containers.
- Runs `Linux` and `Windows` Containers
- You instantiate the container with images from
  - `Docker Hub` or
  - `Azure Container Registry`, here you can host your own images or upload from somewhere.
- AKS runs in Azure on a cluster of VM so the availability is same as Azure VM.

{: .notice--success}
Containers are `light weight` compare to VM. They starts and stops in `Seconds` however VMs in `Minutes`. Link to learn more about [AKS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/).

### Container Instances

{: .notice--info}
游누 **Note** \
\
`Container Instances` is under **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** offering from Microsoft Azure.

- Run `single` containers that makeup your applications
- Starts and stops in `seconds`
- `No` container `orchestrator` needed
  - Can work with orchestrators
- Runs `Linux` and `Windows` Containers
- You instantiate the container with images from
  - `Docker Hub` or
  - `Azure Container Registry`, here you can host your own images or upload from somewhere.
- AKS runs in Azure on a cluster of VM so the availability is same as Azure VM.

### Azure Web App for Containers

{: .notice--info}
游누 **Note** \
\
`Azure Web App for Containers` is under **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** offering from Microsoft Azure.

- You can run container in Azure Web App for Container as Service. This allows you to run container on App Services.
- Starts and stops in `seconds`
- `No` container `orchestrator` needed
- Runs `Linux` and `Windows` Containers
- Use App Service Features
  - Easy to setup `Continuous Deployments` from source control
  - Use `Deployment Slots` which allows you deployment with no `downtime`
  - `Scale` and automatic Scale by adding rules.
- You instantiate the container with images from
  - `Docker Hub` or
  - `Azure Container Registry`, here you can host your own images or upload from somewhere.

### Azure Batch

![](https://imgur.com/q3vIFLU.png){: .full}

{: .notice--info}
游누 **Note** \
\
This is under **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** offering from Microsoft Azure.

- Allows you to run your job across many `Virtual Machines` at `massive` scale (thousands of VMs). You can use it to run a calculating job that needs lots of compute power or rendering video files.
- Orchestrates running your job in parallel
  - `Scaling` across machines
  - `Stages data` for your job so you can insert data into your job.
  - Create `job pipelines` with tasks so you can determine what steps need to be done with the output.
- Runs your job on `Linux` and `Windows` based VMs
- Can `run containers`. So you can run your application in container in Azure Batch. It will run it on as many VMs as needed.

### Azure Service Fabric (Mesh)

{: .notice--info}
游누 **Note** \

{: .notice--success}
Did you know Azure Service Fabrics is a technology that Microsoft uses itself to run many of their own Azure Services, like `Azur e SQL Databases`? Link to learn more about [Azure Service Fabrics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/service-fabric/)

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

7. Cloud Services
8. Web App
9. Mobile App

### Logic as a Service LaaS/Serverless

10. Function App
11. Logic App

## High level Separation

## Working with **Events** to your application in Azure options:

1. Storage Queues
2. Service Bus Queues
3. Service Bus Topics
4. Event Grid
5. Event Hubs
6. IoT Hub
7. Notification Hubs
8. SignalR Services
9. Logic Apps

### Storage Queues

![](https://imgur.com/sugyXgH.png){: .align-left}
Use this if you need **simple queueing mechanism**. Sender and receiver are decoupled. Each message is processed by **one receiver only**. However, **many sender can put the message** on queue. Message must be **string** only. You can convert complex message into `JSON`. The Maximum size of message **64KB**. Azure Storage will provide the **transaction logs** for each message. All of the Azure Storage features will be available here.

### Service Bus Queues

![](https://imgur.com/Zy7AlUJ.png){: .align-left}
Use this as `advance queueing mechanism`. One `ore more applications can put the message` on the queue but still `only one` application can recive the message from queue. Message consists `key/value` properties. Like `customer="Microsoft"` and `id="23"`. Message contains `body` that is `binary data` so it can contain any data like `image, json, text`. Message size `256KB -1MB`. `Dead-letter sub-queue` is there where timed-out or poisoned messages can be placed. It gives duplicate message detection feature out of the box.
