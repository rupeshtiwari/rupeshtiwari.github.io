<h2>Why JavaScript</h2>
<p>I believe JavaScript is very popular language nowadays. I love JavaScript because of many reasons. Now various powerful client side frameworks have been written on JavaScript only. Like RxJS, React, React Native, Angular, VueJS etc., and many more.</p>
<p>Lots of Machine Learning specific libraries are also being written in JavaScript. Big 4 Companies like Microsoft, Google, Facebook and Amazon they all are now appreciating JavaScript and taking interview on JavaScript too.</p>
<h2>JavaScript Important Concepts</h2>
<p>Although learning JavaScript deeply is highly appreciated. However, I believe there are below concepts that one good JavaScript developer must have.</p>
<ol>
<li>bind</li>
<li>Scope</li>
<li>this</li>
<li>undefined vs null</li>
<li>closure</li>
<li>Hoisting</li>
<li>module pattern</li>
