> **Azure Information Protection (AIP)** is a cloud-based solution that enables organizations to **classify** and **protect** documents and emails by applying **labels**.

## How labels apply classification with AIP

Labeling your content with AIP includes:

- **Classification** that can be detected regardless of where the data is stored or with whom it's shared.
- **Visual markings**, such as headers, footers, or watermarks.
- **Metadata**, added to files and email headers in clear text. The clear text metadata ensures that other services can identify the classification and take appropriate action

For example, in the image below, labeling has classified an email message as _General_:

![Sample email footer and headers showing Azure Information Protection classification](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/media/example-email-footerv2.png)

## How AIP protects your data

Azure Information Protection uses the [_Azure Rights Management service_ (Azure RMS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/what-is-azure-rms) to protect your data. Azure RMS uses encryption, identity, and authorization policies.

As soon as the Azure Rights Management service is activated, two default rights management templates are available for you to restrict data access to users within your organization.

The following image shows an example from the Exchange admin center, where you can configure Exchange Online mail flow rules to use RMS templates:

![Example of selecting templates for Exchange Online](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/media/templates-exchangeonline-callouts.png)

Additionally, the AIP client enables users to classify and protect additional file types, or multiple files at once, using the right-click menu from Windows File Explorer. For example:

**Do Not Forward** functionality can be integrated into a label that users can select to apply both classification and protection to that email. For example:

![Selecting a label configured for Do Not Forward](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/media/recipients-only-label2.png)

Use one of the following methods to classify and protect existing content:

- **On-premises storage**: Use the [Azure Information Protection scanner](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/deploy-aip-scanner) to discover, classify, and protect documents on network shares and Microsoft SharePoint Server sites and libraries.

- **Cloud data storage**: Use [Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-app-security/azip-integration) to apply your labels to documents in Box, SharePoint, and OneDrive.
