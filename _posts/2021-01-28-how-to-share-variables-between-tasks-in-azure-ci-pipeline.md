## Passing variables between tasks in the same job
In a script task, you need to print a special value to STDOUT that will be captured by Azure Pipelines to set the variable.


For example, to pass the variable COMMANDS between scripts:
1. Set the value with the command echo `"##vso[task.setvariable variable=COMMANDS]npm run build"`
2. In subsequent tasks, you can use the `$(COMMANDS)` syntax to have Azure Pipelines replace the variable with `npm run build`
3. Alternatively, in the following scripts tasks, `COMMANDS` is also set as environmental variable and can be accessed as `$COMMANDS`
