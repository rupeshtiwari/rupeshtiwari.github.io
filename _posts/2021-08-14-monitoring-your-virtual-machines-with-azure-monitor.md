> You can monitor **performance** and **health** of Virtual Machines and Virtual Machines scale sets, running processors and other resources dependencies with **Azure Monitoring**. This article will help you to prepare for [az-303: Microsoft Azure Architect Technologies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-303).

## Introduction

**Azure Monitoring** is a product that helps you to:

- Deliver **predictable performance and availability**
- Identify **performance bottlenecks** and existing **network issues**
- Identify other dependencies issues and external storage.

## What kind of VMs supported?

- Azure **VMs**
- Azure **VMs scale sets**
- **Hybrid VMs** connected with **Azure Arc**
- **On-premises** virtual machines
- Virtual machines hosted in **another cloud** environment like AWS

## How to configure VMs for Azure Monitoring

1. [Create a Log Analytics Workspace](#creating-log-analytics-workspace)
2. Add **VMInsights solutions** to the Workspace.
3. **Install** **agents** on virtual machine and virtual machine scale sets.

## Limitations on Linux VMs

1. VMs **Red Hat Linux (RHEL)6** does not support "**Available Memory**" feature from Azure Monitoring.
2. **Metrics** are only available for data disks on Linux VMs using **XFS filesystems or EXT filesystem** family (EXT2,EXT3,EXT4)

## Monitoring

Once you have created VM in azure then you can see **insights** under Monitoring group of VMs. You can **enable** monitoring for the virtual machine which will **install** the **agent** on VM to work with Azure Monitor.

You must connect to Log Analytics Workspace also. Then after 5-10 mins VM will start sending data to the Azure Monitoring. All the data goes to Azure Analytics Workspace.
You see 3 kinds of data in Azure monitoring.

List of processes running on virtual machine, which port, IP address, VM properties

### Performance

### Log Analytics Workspace

Log Analytics workspace helps us to:

- Creates alerts when CPU goes high etc.
- Use `Kusto Queries(KQ)` Language to search and analyze logs
- Connect with other Azure services like `Azure Sentinel` for security analytics for entire enterprise.
