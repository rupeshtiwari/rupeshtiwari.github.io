## Installing "Git Tag" DevOp's Extension to Azure Server

I will use the DevOps extension
[Git Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ATP.ATP-GitTag) by
ATP to implement the tagging. The good part of this extension is can be used
both during build and release time. So I will prefer this extension only.

Add this extension to your organization azure devOps server.

If you are using on-premise azure devOps server then learn here
[How to Install extensions for on-premises servers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/marketplace/get-tfs-extensions?view=azure-devops-2020)

## Adding Git Tag Task in Azure Pipelines

Type: Select Build ( if you are tagging while release then select release). I am
doing while build time.

Add this task to your `azure-pipelines.yaml` file.

```yaml
- task: tagBuildOrRelease@0
  displayName: "Add Tag to git"
  inputs:
    type: "Build"
    tags: "TEST-$(Build.BuildNumber)"
```

## Running Azure CI Pipelines

Notice when I run pipeline `Add Tag to git` task succeed
