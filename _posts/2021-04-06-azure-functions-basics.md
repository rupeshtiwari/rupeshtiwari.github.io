> Are you **beginner** on **Azure Functions** and want to learn the basics of Azure Functions? Did you know you can create **Azure Functions** and publish to **Azure** using **Typescript** right from **Visual Studio Code**? In this article, I will walk you through the steps for creating and deploying **Nodejs APIs with Azure Functions using Serverless on Azure** from the beginning.

## What is **Serverless**?

**Serverless** is really complicated way to talk about **other people's computers** ðŸ˜„. Like **Microsoft** **Serverless** has computers servers physically working for you at **Microsoft premises**. There's a **lot of** **servers** involved in saying **serverless**. You want to build your modern application to be **scaled** and you should make sure that you are **correctly paying** for the **right resources** that you need. Sometimes you may have really **complicated problems** in your modern application that have to be solved. This is all taken care by **Serverless** architecture.

> With **serverless** you can focus on the **business code** and think less about the **infrastructure**.

1. ### <i class="fa fa-server" aria-hidden="true" style="color: firebrick"></i> Abstraction of Servers
   - Still there is a server somewhere that you don't need to configure just deploy your code.
2. ### <i class="fa fa-gear fa-spin" style="color: firebrick"></i> Event-Driven / Instant Scale
   - Your code will react to some events happened on **serverless** platform or cloud.
3. ### <i class="fa fa-money" aria-hidden="true" style="color: firebrick"></i> Micro Billing
   - Application can be deployed in single container or thousands of container. However you will only pay when event occurred and your function/code executes. This is micro-billing. So You don't pay if your code is not running. You don't pay continuously to maintain the server, to scale, to secure your server etc.

## Azure Serverless Application Platform Components

**Azure Functions, Logic Apps & Event Grid** are the basic components of **Azure Serverless** Application Platform. These components has access to the Azure **Database, Storage, Security, IoT, Analytics and Intelligence**.

### <i class="fa fa-bolt" style="color: firebrick" aria-hidden="true"></i> Azure Functions

> Execute your code based on events you specify.

This is where you will **write** your code/logic. **Azure Functions** **executes** your code based on **events** you specify. You can think of **Azure Functions** as a service.

### <i class="fa fa-sitemap" aria-hidden="true" style="color: firebrick"></i> Azure Logic Apps

> Using **Logic Apps** **you can design workflow and orchestrate multiple process**.

Many times you want to manage the **workflow** of your **Functions**. You can use **Connectors** present in Logic Apps. **Logic Apps Connectors** like send an email through office 365 etc. You do not need to write the code to connect to those office 365 **API's** they already done by **Logic Apps Connectors**.

### <i class="fa fa-th" style="color: firebrick" aria-hidden="true"></i> Azure Event Grid

> **Event Grid** manages all **events** that can **trigger code** or logic.

It allows us to orchestrate events and interact with them.

## What is Azure Functions?

With **Azure Functions**, I don't need to think about **computers**, **server machines** and I just need to think about **functions**. As an organization you can ship your business functionality out of the door faster to production using **Azure Functions**.

1. **Azure Functions** has **Multiple Language** Support
2. Integration with other services like:
   1. **Azure Key Vault**
   2. **Azure DevOps**
3. **Azure Functions** provides flexible options will support even the most **mission critical** enterprise workloads.

### Azure Function is Useful

**Azure Function** says take the code that you care about that **powers** your application as per business. **Publish** that code in **Azure** Let azure to take care about **scaling** , **operating**, **securing** and **resilient**.

### Azure Functions Development Tools

One of the great thing about **Azure Serverless & Functions** is the integration with **development tooling**. **Azure Serverless** is well integrated with:

1. **Azure Serverless** is well integrated **Visual Studio Code**
2. **Visual Studio**
3. **IntelliJ**
4. **Eclipse** for Java Functions

On top of that Azure Functions has other development advantages like IDE support, Integrated DevOps, Local Development, Monitoring and Visual Debug History.

## Creating New Azure Functions Project using Typescript

We will build **NodeJS API** using **Azure Serverless**.

### Installing Azure Functions Extensions in Visual Studio Code

Install [Azure Functions extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions) for Visual Studio from Microsoft. It will install **Azure Account** automatically.

![](https://i.imgur.com/0eqRtLM.png)

### Sign In to Azure Account from Visual Studio Code

1. Click Azure Extension Icon on Visual Studio code **Alt+Shift+A**
   ![](https://i.imgur.com/Y21Wdi7.png)
2. Select **[Sign in to Azure](https://portal.azure.com/)** and login to your azure account.
   ![](https://i.imgur.com/3M3CXPo.png)
   ![](https://i.imgur.com/YSwRPqY.png)
3. Select Azure Subscriptions
   ![](https://i.imgur.com/yrPBdxW.png)
4. Alternatively you can just do CTRL+SHIFT+P in VS Code and search for **Azure Sign In** A browser window should show up, asking you to sign in. Then suddenly your Microsoft Azure Account Extension should work again and it will pre-select the available.

### Creating New Azure Functions Project

I will be able to deploy the functions logically connected to the same resource. In Visual Studio code Azure Extensions You can

1. Create Project
2. Create Azure Functions
3. And Deploy them in Azure

![](https://i.imgur.com/kmseV69.png)

Lets create new project. You can choose any language out of **JavaScript, Typescript, C#, Python, Java, PowerShell**. I will select **Typescript**

![](https://i.imgur.com/sBOTnXI.png)

Next you will see pre-built templates available:
![](https://i.imgur.com/lsjIzkH.png)

I will start with clean project so I will select **skip now**. Notice I get the project created.

![](https://i.imgur.com/xmBS1Yr.png)

### Azure Functions Project Code Walkthrough

#### **.vscode folder**

I will run `npm i` to install all dev dependencies. All of the magical code to connect to azure is placed inside the **.vscode** folder. You are mostly no need to know what code it has and no need to modify it.

![](https://i.imgur.com/BPipSfX.png)

#### **host.json**

**host.json** defines which version of **azure** you are using. I am using **2.0** which is stable version supported for all **operating systems** now. In this file you can also **configure** other **root/project level settings**. Suppose you are using Http function then you can define the routing root api etc.

```json
{
  "version": "2.0",ðŸ‘ˆ
  "logging": {
    "applicationInsights": {
      "samplingSettings": {
        "isEnabled": true,
        "excludedTypes": "Request"
      }
    }
  },
  "extensionBundle": {
    "id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
    "version": "[1.*, 2.0.0)"
  }
}
```

#### local.settings.json

This is where we **configure our application settings** that we want to use in our local. So imagine when u r building functions or project that u run in your local want to connect your developer database development. You move to production you want to connect to production database. So here you will define **Database Connection Strings**.

```json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "",
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "node"
  }
}
```

### Proxies.json

You can create a **thin layer on top of your existing azure functions** application. You can **group multiple function apps **within the same proxy as your functions proxy.

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json.schemastore.org/proxies",
  "proxies": {}
}
```

## Creating Your First Azure Functions

Next let's add a brand new azure functions in our newly created azure functions project.

### List of Azure Function Events

Click on the thunder+ icon on vscode
![](https://i.imgur.com/2zD1evW.png)
And it will show all of the pre-existed events. You can select from them. This event list is growing very fast.
![](https://i.imgur.com/dNuZixB.png)

Like you can write function to react on:

1. Http Request
2. Changes in blog storage account
3. Queue Storage
4. Service Bus
5. Timer trigger (React on Timeout or Interval etc.)

### Creating an HTTP Trigger Azure Functions

1. Let's create HTTP trigger

![](https://i.imgur.com/UQ940kt.png) 2. Give name `read-users`

![](https://i.imgur.com/xE2zfZg.png) 3. **Authorization Level** Generally there are 3 levels of authorizations:
![](https://i.imgur.com/plRsycf.png)

1.  **Anonymous** means anyone can access the URL.
2.  **Function** means you will create a unique **secrete code** while running function you must pass this code otherwise you will get **HTTP 401 Unauthorized** error. This authorization functionality is already present in **platform**. You don't have to write any code for this.
3.  **Admin** means only **your subscriptions** will be able to call into this function and this can be useful when you want to guard your code and working on premise or company.

Lets select **Anonymous** for this demo. Notice our first **Azure Functions** is created.

![](https://i.imgur.com/hYMwkmM.png)

### Azure Functions Code Walkthrough

Notice our **folder name** is same as our **function name** `read-users`.

#### function.json

```json
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "authLevel": "anonymous",
      "type": "httpTrigger",
      "direction": "in",ðŸ‘ˆ
      "name": "req",
      "methods": [
        "get",
        "post"
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "http",
      "direction": "out",ðŸ‘ˆ
      "name": "res"
    }
  ],
  "scriptFile": "../dist/read-users/index.js"
}

```

**function.json** is a file where our function configuration is defined. Array of bindings you will see 2 bindings.

1. **First** binding is for input. Where you say http trigger that you are ready for **listening** for **incoming Http Requests**.
2. **Second** binding is for output. Where you tell **azure functions** runtime that you are returning an **HTTP response**.

#### index.ts File

```ts
import { AzureFunction, Context, HttpRequest } from '@azure/functions';

const httpTrigger: AzureFunction = async function (
  context: Context,
  req: HttpRequest
): Promise<void> {
  context.log('HTTP trigger function processed a request.');
  const name = req.query.name || (req.body && req.body.name);
  const responseMessage = name
    ? 'Hello, ' + name + '. This HTTP triggered function executed successfully.'
    : 'This HTTP triggered function executed successfully. Pass a name in the query string or in the request body for a personalized response.';

  context.res = {
    // status: 200, /* Defaults to 200 */
    body: responseMessage,
  };
};

export default httpTrigger;
```

In the **index.ts** file has JavaScript function. **Context** object that enable us to communicate with the platform **runtime**. Next is the **HttpRequest** object.

Use Context to log some message:

```ts
context.log('HTTP trigger function processed a request.');
```

Finally, we return a string as our response body.

## Running Azure Functions Locally in Visual Studio Code

Next let's run our azure functions and see our server side endpoint up and running.

### Installing Azure Functions Core Tools

First you must install [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools#installing) in Visual Studio Code Azure Functions Project. Run below to install it.

`npm i -g azure-functions-core-tools@3 --unsafe-perm true`

### Debugging & Running Local Azure Functions

Let's now run our first azure function on visual studio code.

CMD+SHIFT+P ( CTRL + SHIFT + P) and search for **Debug:Start Debugging**

![](https://i.imgur.com/Vg72PYR.png)

This will build the project since it is in typescript. Next it will make the api up and running at **port 7071** http://localhost:7071/api/read-users

![](https://i.imgur.com/9x4aOAb.png)

### Calling Azure Functions API GET

Just Navigate to URL http://localhost:7071/api/read-users and notice you see the response that we have sent from server.
This is simulating our get call.

![](https://i.imgur.com/qxHWq7q.png)

If you pass **query string** you get that output.

http://localhost:7071/api/read-users?name=Rupesh%20Tiwari

![](https://i.imgur.com/1XdHX7V.png)

### Debugging Azure Functions

Now you can add the debug point at any lines of code in your azure functions and the again visit the GET URL. Notice you can now debug the code and watch variables values.

![](https://i.imgur.com/NQ80IAD.png)

## Deploying Function Summary

While deploying Azure Function to Azure You have to specify:

1. `Function Apps` associated to an App Service Plan.
2. `Subscription`
3. `Resource Group`
4. `App Service Plan`
5. `Storage Account` (every Azure functions requires storage account)

Once deployment is done then all the Functions within the Project get deploys to the Function App within the same App Service Plan.
