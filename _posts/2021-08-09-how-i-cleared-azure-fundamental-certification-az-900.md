## How to Motivate yourself?

Very important thing is to keep yourself motivated to prepare and give exams. Specially when you are a working professional and having married with family and kids. You will be almost busy with work and family and seldom get chance to carve out time to learn new things.

I am getting up at 5 AM and scheduling my studies accordingly. I used to learn Azure in the morning time before my office starts.

In order to keep my self motivated I used to read [Swami Vivekananda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Vivekananda). One of his best quote that I remember is:

_"Whatever you believe, that you will be. [There is nothing to obstruct you!"_](https://quoteideas.com/swami-vivekananda-quotes/)

So foldout your motivation and keep yourself inspired and upgrade your IT skills.

## What should I read for Az 900?

The best resource for me was [Microsoft Azure on-line free courses for Az 900](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900). You should finish that course first which is divided in 6 parts.

### Azure Fundamentals Certification (AZ 900)

**Azure Fundamentals** certification needs 6 part to be finished.

1. Part 1: Describe core Azure concepts
2. Part 2: Describe core Azure services
3. Part 3: Describe core solutions and management tools on Azure
4. Part 4: Describe general security and network security features
5. Part 5: Describe identity, governance, privacy, and compliance features
6. Part 6: Describe Azure cost management and service level agreements

Once you finish your on-line course you will receive badges from Microsoft like I got.

### Solve Question Answers given after each course in Microsoft on-line.

After finishing each module you will be asked questions. Make sure you give them to concrete your understanding.

**Sample Questions**

### Read previous Az 900 exam questions

Next you must read some of the previous questions that already came in AZ-900 exams. I prepared [from this link](https://www.exam-answer.com/microsoft/az-900).

## Finally You will schedule for **exam**

Scheduling exam is an on-line process. You have to pay $99 as of today this is the fee.

## Exam from home or Center?

I choose to go to center (lab) for exam. You could choose to give exam from home. However, there are many restrictions when you give from home and I was not that comfortable.

## In the exam center

When you go to the exam center. First thing you need to fill form where you write in time, your name and exam name. Then you will be asked 2 ID proof I provided one my Driving License and the other proof I gave my credit card. Then she took my picture and gave mea locker key, A small white board (made of paper) with marker.

Here is me standing in-front of my exam building facility.

I was supposed to put all belongings like (mobile, watch, keys, cards) inside the locker. Then I entered in the exam room with Mask (mandatory).

Azure 900 exam was 48 minutes and 38 questions. I attempted all questions since there was no negative marking.

## You will get score immediately

The good part is you will get you score after completing exam. My score is 950.
