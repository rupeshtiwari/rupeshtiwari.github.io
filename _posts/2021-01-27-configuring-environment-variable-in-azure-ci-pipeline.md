> Pipeline and access them in your azure pipeline task? Example: If you are
> using [nx monorepo](https://nx.dev/) and you want to skip the Nx Caching while
> building your project in Azure pipeline or your build machine then read this
> article to understand it.

## Access Environment Variable in YML file

Prefix it with a dollar sign and enclose it in parentheses. For example:
`$(SKIP_NX_CACHE)`

## Access Environment Variable in Script

use environment variable syntax. Replace . and space with \_, capitalize the
letters, and then use your platform's syntax for referencing an environment
variable. Examples:

1. Batch script: `%SKIP_NX_CACHE%`
2. PowerShell script: `${env:SKIP_NX_CACHE}`
3. Bash script: `$(SKIP_NX_CACHE)`

## Example Accessing Environment Variable in You Nx Monorepo CI Pipeline

```yaml=
pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

trigger:
  - main

variables:
  CAN_SKIP_NX_CACHE: $[eq(variables['SKIP_NX_CACHE'], 'True')] # Reading CAN_SKIP_NX_CACHE environment variable.

steps:
    - script: node ./build.js $(SKIP_NX_CACHE) # Calling your build script with environment variable value.
```

While running new pipeline from azure portal. You can always select your
variable and update its value to false or true that will be passed to your build
pipeline.
