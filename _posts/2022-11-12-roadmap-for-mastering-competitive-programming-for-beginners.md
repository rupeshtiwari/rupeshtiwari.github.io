> Are you non-computer background student? I am a electronics engineering student and have been in software company and worked more than 16 years from junior developer to as full stack developer with angular and c# asp.net and various web development technologies. How should I plan to learn competitive programming in order to crack Big 4 (Google, Facebook, Amazon & Microsoft) companies coding-interviews?

If you are a beginner like me, never start directly solving competitive programming problems. First solve Data Structure and Algorithm problems. [Read this to know what is the difference between Data Structure and Algorithm problems and Competitive Programming problems](https://rupeshtiwari.com/how-to-start-preparing-for-coding-interview/).

Start solving problems in below sequence to practice:

- Solve Data Structure and Algorithm problems
- Solve Competitive Programming problems.

## Which Language should I use in a coding interview?Â 

Many companies donâ€™t prefer Python in coding interviews. Because, it has an in-built library for stack or so on. If you are doing Python then learn one more language in backup ( C#, C, C++ or Java ). Python is mostly used in Data Science and Machine Learning since these topics are very complex and you must write less code to solve these big problems.Â I personally use **JavaScript** language.

## Where should I practice for DS and Algo problems?Â 

Use geeksforgeeks.com to practice data structure and algorithm problems.

- Solve Problems for DS & Algo
- Reading company interview experiences

Amazon, FB etc. they ask the questions from the Geek for Geeks sometime. So it is a good idea to solve them.Â  Geeks For Geeks is the best site to start learning coding for any beginners.

- Go to [https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/)
- Then do 50 questions per data structures
- Do more than 50 for Array and String

In Geek of Geeks you can filter difficulty level and you can also check which problem is asked in which company. Select Array then filter by Basic, Medium or Hard then work on them.

Every day you do **2 basic, 2 medium and 1 hard** problems for each data structure

## Which Data Structure Problem Should I Focus and solve?Â 

Do 50 questions on below data structures. Do 70 questions on Array and Linked List. First solve the problems which are described in the [data structure in hindi videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5JfBFfi2sU&list=PLg6p_zdrEgHEqaRQbZADU6suNgh28JiKb&index=1). Then solve others on your own. If you don't watch videos and try to solve your own in Geek of Geeks you will solve 5 problems. However, if you watch videos and solve them then you should be able to solve 15 problems on your own.Â  Do below Data Structure:

- Array
- Link List
- Stack
- Queue
- Tree
- Graph

## Which Algorithm Problem Should I Do?Â 

Most of the companies ask DP problems, they are very important.

- Sorting - do 50 problems
- Greedy - do 70 problems
- Dynamic Programming - do 70 problems

If you finish Dynamic programming then whatever Data Structure concepts that you have first finished. There you can optimize your solution using Dynamic Programming.

## Where should I practice Competitive Programming Problems?

- [LeetCode.com](https://leetcode.com/) is best for practicing for competitive programing.
- [codechef.com/](https://www.codechef.com/) is also good.

Participate in competitive problem competitions like:

- Long Challenge:Â  Within 10 days you have to solve problems
- Cook Off
- Lunch Time: Within 2-3 hours solve problems

## Do not start with Hard or Medium Problems

When you are a beginner do not start directly with hard or medium problems otherwise you will be disheartened and you may lose your interest to learn coding. Therefore, I would advise not to waste time solving hard problems or mediums. Rather start with easy problems to build some confidence.
