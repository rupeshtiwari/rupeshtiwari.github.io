> ​This article will teach you t​he how to configure and implement **diagnostics log** for Azure resources. This article will help you to prepare for [az-303: Microsoft Azure Architect Technologies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-303).

## Introduction

**Implement and Monitor an Azure Infrastructure** is 50-55% in Az-303. Under **Implement cloud infrastructure monitoring** we have below topics to cover:

## Implementing Infrastructure Monitoring with Azure Monitor 🐒

We will use **Azure Platform Logs** to get the detail logs of the Azure resources.

### Azure Platform Logs

Provides detailed **diagnostics** and **auditing** information for Azure resources and the Azure platform they depend on.

### Types of Platform Logs

Azure platform logs are of 2 types:

1. **Activity Logs**: This works on **subscription** level. Who did what and when can be seen here. Example who deleted Azure blob container or Azure Key Vault etc. You can check all of the write operations here.
2. **Resource Logs**: **Created for each individual resource**. You can get logs like who was trying to fetch secretes from **Azure vault Instance**?

### Destinations of Logs

Use the **Diagnostic settings** to configure Azure Resources to write platform logs to different destinations. ![](https://imgur.com/31ZUgS4.png) ![](https://imgur.com/Bsl9lSA.png)
Logs can send to below places:
![](https://imgur.com/zVHJ9NF.png)

1. **Log Analytics Workspace**: Analyze logs using [**Kusto queries**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/tutorial?pivots=azuredataexplorer) in Azure Data Explorer. Leverage **Alerts** and **Visualizations**.
2. **Archive to Storage Account**: Cheaper option so you can keep your log for long time.
3. **Stream to an event hub**: To stream logs to external systems. Example: security information & event management software.

### Destination Requirements

1. In order to log at **Analytics Workspace** make sure you put both workspace and resource instance at the **same region**. This gives performance also.
2. For streaming to **Event Hubs** you need **Send**, **Listen** and **Manage** permissions.
3. For **storage account log**. Create new storage account for log only don't put other data in this. So that you have good control over logs.

### Demo Configure Logging

We will create **Analytics Workspace, Azure Storage Account and Event Hub** for logging our **Azure Function Resource**. Next we will configure the Diagnostics Settings to write logs to all of the above destinations.

#### Creating Log Storage Account

First create Azure storage for logging at the same region as your Azure resource exist. Sign in to the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com and follow steps.

#### Creating Log Analytics Workspace

A Log Analytics workspace provides:

- A **Geographic Location** for the **data storage**.
- **Data isolation** by granting different users access rights following one of our recommended design strategies.
- **Scope for configuration** of settings like pricing tier, retention, and data capping.

![](https://imgur.com/Uma4T5m.gif)
Let's [create a workspace for Analytics Workspace logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/quick-create-workspace). When you create workspace in the **same region** as the Azure resources it manages then there is **no** **outbound data transfer charges**.

#### Configure Diagnostic Setting to send logs To Analytics Workspace and Azure storage

Next let's find our azure function and create diagnostic settings to send the log to Analytics Workspace and Storage Account together.

#### Creating Event Hub for Logging

Sign in to the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com and follow steps:
![](https://imgur.com/wMdGcUo.gif)

📓 Make sure you give Shared access policy as **Manage, Send and Listen** to the Event Hub.

#### Configure Diagnostic Setting to send logs to Event Hub

Sign in to the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com and follow steps:
