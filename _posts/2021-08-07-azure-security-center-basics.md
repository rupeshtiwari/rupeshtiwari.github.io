> **Azure Security Center** is the base infrastructure service to collect logs analyze them and generate tailored recommendations. Learn how can you review and fix **general**, **cloud** securities and manage security concerns of your resources in Azure. This article will help you to prepare for [az-303: Microsoft Azure Architect Technologies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-303).

**Azure Security center** is a unified infrastructure security management system.

This is your "**base layer**" for monitoring the **security** configuration and **health** of your workloads. Azure Security Center collects events from **Azure** or **log analytics agents** and correlates them in a **security analytics engine**, to provide you with tailored recommendations (hardening tasks). Strengthening your security posture can be achieved by implementing these **recommendations**.

The Azure Security Center uses a built-in Azure Policy initiative in audit-only mode (the Azure Security Benchmark) as well as Azure Monitor logs and other Azure security solutions like Microsoft Cloud App Security.

### Security Challenges

1. In cloud **workloads are changing quickly** and we must make sure the developers/devops are following the security best practices while provisioning the resources.
2. Internet **Security attacks** risk is always there if your resources are internet facing.
3. Also Security **skills are less** with developers.

### Solving Security Challenges

1. **Strengthen Security Posture**: Using Azure Security Monitor you can examine your resources and give you security reports.
2. **Protect against threats**: Azure security monitor can generate security alerts and raises threat prevention suggestions on your Azure resources.
3. **Auto Secure**: You can give auto-provisioning to resolve security issues faster.

### Resources Protected by Azure Security Center

There are lots of resources which are automatically **protected and monitor** by security center.

1. All **Azure PaaS resources** like DB engine and Storage accounts.
2. **Non-Azure** **Virtual Machines** on cloud or on premises. You must install Log Analytics Agents on them ( both windows and Linux ) supported.
3. **Azure VMs**
4. **Security alerts** are created when threat is found on the **azure workloads**. One has to investigate the security alerts.
