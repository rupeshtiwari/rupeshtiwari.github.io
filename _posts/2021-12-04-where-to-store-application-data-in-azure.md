`Azure SQL Database` can store **Relational Data**. It is optimized for [**OLTP (Online Transactional Processing)**](#online-transaction-processing-oltp-datastores).

- SQL Server in the cloud
- Managed and Scalable by Azure
- Highly available 99.99%
- Redundant, data is replicated 3 times in the local data-center and 3 times to another data-center. Data is backed up every 5 minutes and every hour a full backup is made.
- Relational data can be used as table rows and columns.
- Use it with Microsoft tools
  - SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio), Azure Portal, Visual Studio
- Advanced capabilities
  - **Geo-replication** (single writable node): which actively replicate data to other geographical region. Other geo replicable databases are read-only.
  - **Automatic tuning**: where Azure SQL analyzes which queries are slow and it will apply required indexes to improve speed.
  - **Threat detection**: it can detect malicious behavior on the database and alert you to take action.
  - **Dynamic Data Masking**: which can automatically mask sensitive data like password, credit card number etc. So un-authorized or un-wanted user can only see masked data only.

The main difference among `Azure SQL, MySQL, PSQL and MariaDB` is the `ecosystem` they are in and the skillset that you need for them. If you are comfortable on `LAMP` stack and working with `MySQL` then Azure Databases for `MySQL` or `MariaDB` is good for you. If you are comfortable working in `pgAdmin` or similar tool and you are not using `T-SQL` to manage database then use `Azure PostgreSQL`.
