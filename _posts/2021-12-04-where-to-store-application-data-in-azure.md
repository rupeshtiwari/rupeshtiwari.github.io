### Azure SQL Database

{: .notice--info}
游누 **Important** \
\
`Azure SQL Database` can store **Relational Data**.

- SQL Server in the cloud
- Managed and Scalable by Azure
- Highly available 99.99%
- Redundant, data is replicated 3 times in the local data-center and 3 times to another data-center. Data is backed up every 5 minutes and every hour a full backup is made.
- Relational data can be used as table rows and columns.
- Use it with Microsoft tools
  - SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio), Azure Portal, Visual Studio
- Advanced capabilities
  - **Geo-replication** (single writable node): which actively replicate data to other geographical region. Other geo replicable databases are read-only.
  - **Automatic tuning**: where Azure SQL analyzes which queries are slow and it will apply required indexes to improve speed.
  - **Threat detection**: it can detect malicious behavior on the database and alert you to take action.
  - **Dynamic Data Masking**: which can automatically mask sensitive data like password, credit card number etc. So un-authorized or un-wanted user can only see masked data only.

- Works well in the LAMP stack
  - Linux, Apache server, MySQL and PHP
- Use it with tools for MySQL because most of the Azure tools are not supported for MySQL database.
  - `MySQL Workbench` and `SQLyog`, drivers for PHP, Java, Node.js and .NET.
  - Can integrate with[ Azure App Service](https://www.rupeshtiwari.com/what-should-you-use-for-running-applications-in-azure/#azure-app-services-web-apps)

{: .notice--success}
`MySQL` is `open-source` database. Learn more about [Azure Databases for MySQL](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/mysql/#features)

{: .notice--info}
游누 **Important** \
\
`Azure Databases for PostgreSQL` can store **Relational Data**.

- MariaDB in the cloud
- Managed and Scalable by Azure
- Highly available 99.99%
- Redundant, data is replicated 3 times in the local data-center and 3 times to another data-center. Data is backed up every 5 minutes and every hour a full backup is made.
- Relational data can be used as table rows and columns.
- Supports different storage engines that allows to store data in other format like
  - `Apache Cassandra, CSV, ColumnStore`
- Use it with the tools for MariaDB
  - `Database Workbench` and `SQLyog`

{: .notice--success}
Did you know **MariaDB** is forked out from **MySQL** and `open source`? Learn more about [Azure Databases for MariaDB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mariadb/#:~:text=Azure%20Database%20for%20MariaDB%20is,predictable%20performance%20and%20dynamic%20scalability.)

### Azure Cosmos DB

![](https://imgur.com/xr0vqr0.png)

{: .notice--info}
游누 **Important** \
\
`Azure Cosmos DB` can store **Document Data**.

- Distributed, massive scale database
- Use it with several APIs to work with your data in many different ways and they abstract the way that Azure Cosmos DB stores and handles the data.
  - DocumentDB API
  - MongoDB API
  - Table API
  - Graph API
  - Apache Cassandra API
- Since it is `noSQL` you do not need to predefine the schema
- **Automatic indexing**: Cosmos DB will automatically create and apply and manages indexes required on data. You can customize the indexing policy if you want.
- **Geo-replication** (single writable node): which actively replicate data to other geographical region. Other geo replicable databases are read-only.
- Unique SLA is offered by CosmosDB
  - SLA `99.99%` availability
  - SLA `99.99%` availability for `read` operation
  - Latency on `read` `< 10ms`, `writes < 15ms`
    This latency counts from the Cosmos DB to other Azure services.

{: .notice--success}
`Apache Cassandra `is a `free` and `open-source`, distributed, wide-column store, NoSQL database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure.

### Azure Storage

`Azure Storage` can store **Unstructured/Document Data**.

- Massive scale, multiple-purpose storage.
- Multiple models in a storage account
  - File Storage
  - Blob Storage
  - Queue Storage
  - Table Storage
  - Disk Storage

All storage come with overall features and capabilities that Azure Storage provides like

- **Shared Access Signatures**: provides temporary access to some operations on storage type like Blob storage. This is useful for implementing the `valet key` pattern.
- `Firewalls` and `Virtual Network` using this you can increase security to your Azure storage data.
- `Data encryption` at rest. Azure storage will encrypt and decrypt the data for you out of the box.
- Storage replication
  - **Locally-redundant** : 3 copies of the data stored in the local data-center
  - **Geo-redundant**: In addition to Locally-redundant, it will store 3 copies of data in the other geographical data-center
  - **Read-access-geo-redundant**: You can also create readable Geo-redundant also.
