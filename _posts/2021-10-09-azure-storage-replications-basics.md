LRS (locally redundant storage)
ZRS (zone redundant storage)
GRS (geographically redundant storage)
RA GRS (read-access geographically redundant storage)
GZRS (geographically zone redundant storage)
RA GZRS (read-access geographically zone redundant storage)

Availability and Durability
Disaster recovery
Recovery time objectives (RTO)
Maximum acceptable time that an application can be un-available after an incident happen.
Read only access to a secondary region

Redundancy in primary region
Redundancy in secondary region
Read access to data in secondary region

## Local Redundant Storage

![](https://imgur.com/42eGmb4.png)
In the **same data center** and **same region** **3 copies** of your data is saved. Fire or flooding can impact the data center and your data is stored in a single data center only.

## Zone Redundant Storage (ZRS)

![](https://imgur.com/3QYNQt4.png)
Within the **same region** you can have **3 availability zones** where **3 copies** of data will be replicated. If your primary azure data center is **down** then azure **repoint** the DNS of the storage account to **other zone**. Each zone is **physically separate**.

**Disadvantages:**

- It is not available for every azure region
- It does not support
  - archived tier of blob
  - managed, un-managed disks.
