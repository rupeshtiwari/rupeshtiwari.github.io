> Learn some important built-in very helpful methods in Powershell. It could be a quick note for you so don't forget to bookmark this article! ðŸ¥‡

## Try Catch in PowerShell

Using built-in exceptions.

```powershell
try {
   $wc = new-object System.Net.WebClient
   $wc.DownloadFile("http://www.contoso.com/MyDoc.doc","c:\temp\MyDoc.doc")
}
catch [System.Net.WebException],[System.IO.IOException] {
    "Unable to download MyDoc.doc from http://www.contoso.com."
}
catch {
    "An error occurred that could not be resolved."
}
```

Printing Anonymous Exception details.

```powershell
try { NonsenseString }
catch {
  Write-Host "An error occurred:"
  Write-Host $_
  # will print the error details.
}
```

```error
An Error occurred:
The term 'NonsenseString' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function,
script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path
was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.
```

## Try Catch Finally in Powershell

```powershell
try { NonsenseString }
catch {
  Write-Host "An error occurred:"
  Write-Host $_
  # will print the error details.
}
finally {
  Write-Host "I can move temporary log file to permanent location."
}
```

## if else case in Powershell

```powershell
if(Boolean_expression) {
   // Executes when the Boolean expression is true
}else {
   // Executes when the Boolean expression is false
}
```

- **-eq** to check **equality**.
- **-le** to check **less than**.

Example: Comparing Less than in Powershell

```powershell
$x = 30

if($x -le 18){
   write-host "You can't get driving license!"
} else {
   write-host "You are eligible for Driving License!"
}
```

Example: Comparing equality check

```powershell
$file1Timestamp = [datetime](get-date -date '1989-09-25 8AM')

$file2Timestamp = [datetime](get-date -date '1989-09-25 10AM')

if($file1Timestamp -eq $file2Timestamp) {
    write-host "File is not modified"
} else {
    write-host "File is modified"
}
```

## Throwing custom error in Powershell

```powershell
Function Do-Something
{
    throw "Your custom error"
    # This creates a runtime exception
    # that is a terminating error.
}
```

## Multiple line comment in Powershell

<#
Function Do-Something
{
Write-Host "The entire function is commented"
}
#>

## Contains vs Match vs Like in Powershell

`Contains` is used for collection and **Tells whether a collection of reference values includes a single test value.**

```powershell
"abc" -contains "b" # return False
```

```powershell
 "abc","xyz" -contains "abc"
```

`Match` is used in string and it uses regular expression to search in string.

```powershell
"c:\temp\web\config.js" -match "b\\config.js" # True
```

`Like` is used in string and it uses wild card search

```powershell
"c:\temp\web\config.js" -like "*b\config.js" # True
```

Whenever error occurs in batch file it save the error code in the environment variable `%ERRORLEVEL%`

```shell
echo "ReturnÂ Code:" %ERRORLEVEL%
```
