> Learn what service from Azure you should use while creating your application in Azure. This article has quick short answer for when to use what in Azure service? Get [free e-book on Design Distributed Systems](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/designing-distributed-systems/).
> It is difficult to compare options available in Azure. The comparison with the features of the options provides you tools to choose the right service with your requirements.

## Running Application in Azure Options

You can use various services from Azure to run your applications. It depends what exactly is your requirements. Below are the services available from Azure.
