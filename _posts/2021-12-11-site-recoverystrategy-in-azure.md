> Learn the failover and failback stages in Site Recovery on Azure. Learn **Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery** (BCDR) strategy in Azure.

## Failover and failback in Site Recovery has four stages

**Stage 1: Fail over from on-premises:** After setting up replication to Azure for on-premises machines, when your on-premises site goes down, you fail those machines over to Azure. After failover, Azure VMs are created from replicated data.

**Stage 2: Reprotect Azure VMs:** In Azure, you reprotect the Azure VMs so that they start replicating back to the on-premises site. The on-premises VM (if available) is turned off during reprotection, to help ensure data consistency.

**Stage 3: Fail over from Azure:** When your on-premises site is running as normal again, you run another failover, this time to fail back Azure VMs to your on-premises site. You can fail back to the original location from which you failed over, or to an alternate location.

**Stage 4: Reprotect on-premises machines:** After failing back, again enable replication of the on-premises machines to Azure.
