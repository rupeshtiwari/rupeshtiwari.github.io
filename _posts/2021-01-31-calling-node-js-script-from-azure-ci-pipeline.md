> If you want to run **node.js script** from **azure-pipelines.yml** and get the
> value returned from node.js script and use it in your CI next task. Then read
> this article. Example: I wanted to get new build number as per my package.json
> next version by running node script and update my CI pipeline build number.

## Introduction

In this article I will show:

- How can you call `build.js` file to create new build number using package.json
  file & Azure CI pipeline build Id.
- Then update Azure CI pipeline build number with the returned new build number.
- Our new build number should be like **<buildId>-<branchname>** example:
  **123-main** or **123-feature1**

## Creating JavaScript to create new Build Number

Create build.js file and here we will take `buildId` and `branch-name` as
parameter passed from `azure-pipelines.yml` file.

Then we will increase the build id by one and add branch name and use that as
new Build Number.

```javascript
const buildId = process.argv[2];
const sourceBranchName = process.argv[3];
const newVersion = `${+buildId + 1}-${sourceBranchName}`;

console.log(newVersion); //Console Log will return the new version to Azure Pipelines.
```

👉 **Remember when you write value using console log in your node.js script.
Then that value will be shared to the azure pipelines.yml file.**

Therefore, do not write console log in your script which you don't want to pass
to azure pipeline.

## Creating Azure Pipelines file

Note: When you are creating a variable that is scoped within a single task. Then

- use `export` to set a variable
- And use `$variable` syntax to access variable value.

In below example we create `num` variable and we use `$num` to read the value of
the variable.

```yaml
trigger:
  - main

steps:
  # calling node.js script
  - script: |
      export num=$(node ./build.js $(Build.BuildId) $(Build.SourceBranchName))
      echo "node.js returned $num"
    displayName: "Executing Node.js script"
```

## Running Azure CI Pipeline

## Returning multiple value from Node.js to Azure pipeline

In order to return one value make sure just do single console.log and you will
return exactly that value. Just like we did for build number above.

In order to return multiple values to Azure pipeline from node.js script. Don't
write multiple console.logs.

For example if u want to return build and test command to azure pipeline then
use below syntax in your node.js script file.

```javascript=
console.log({
build: 'npm run build',
test: 'npm test'
})
```

## Updating the Build Number with new build number given by node.js script

We will use `"##vso[build.updatebuildnumber]$newNumber"` script to update build
number.

Add script to update the build number in the Azure pipelines

```yaml
- script: |
    echo "old buildnumber ~>$(Build.BuildNumber)"
    export num=$(node ./build.js $(Build.BuildId) $(Build.SourceBranchName))
    echo "node.js returned $num"
    echo "##vso[build.updatebuildnumber]$num"
  displayName: "Update Build Number"
```

Add another new script to show the build number.

💡 Do not show the build number on the same previous task otherwise it will
display the old build only. You must create new script to show the updated build
number.

```yaml
- script: echo "new buildnumber ~>$(Build.BuildNumber)"
  displayName: "Display New Build Number"
```
