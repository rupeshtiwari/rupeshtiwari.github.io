> `Publish Code Coverage task` Publishes `Cobertura` or `JaCoCo` code coverage
> results from your build in azure CI Pipeline.

Azure DevOps provides us with the ability to show an overview of the code
coverage of our application's unit tests. To do so, just like publishing the
test results in a specific format, we'll need to publish the code coverage
results in a supported format. Currently, Azure DevOps supports both `Cobertura`
and `JaCoCo`.

## In Angular Generating Code Coverage using Cobertura

In Angular out of the box you get `karma-coverage-istanbul-reporter`. The
**Istanbul**, the code coverage tool used by the Angular CLI, has support for
**Cobertura** built-in, so we don't need to add any dependency in order to use
Cobertura.

![](https://i.imgur.com/8DX15qu.png)

Go to `karma.conf.js` you should see below `coverageIstanbulReporter` settings.

```json
   coverageIstanbulReporter: {
      dir: join(__dirname, '../../coverage'),
      reports: ['html', 'lcovonly',],
      fixWebpackSourcePaths: true,
    },
```

Add `cobertura` and `text-summary` reporters

`reports: ['html', 'lcovonly','text-summary', 'cobertura'],`

```json
   coverageIstanbulReporter: {
      dir: join(__dirname, '../../coverage'),
      reports: ['html', 'lcovonly','text-summary', 'cobertura'],
      fixWebpackSourcePaths: true,
    },
```

Run this command so that angular will generate code coverage. If you are not
using Nx.Monorepo then instead `ng` use `nx`.

`nx test --watch=false --code-coverage`

When you use `text-summary` you should also see the summary in vs code console.

If you do not want this summary every time u run test then consider removing
`text-summary`

In My case I will remove `text-summary` Now lets run

`nx affected:test --base=main --codeCoverage=true`

See it will create coverage folder and files for each projects in your nx
monorepo workspace.

## Enforcing Code Coverage Threshold in Angular App

You can fail test if threshold is not meet. Add below code in
`coverageIstanbulReporter`

```json
  thresholds: {
        statements: 80,
        lines: 80,
        branches: 80,
        functions: 80
      }
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/q1Uu6Zv.png)

Now after running test you will see below error. If you have not wrote
sufficient tests to meet the threshold.

## Publishing Angular Code Coverage Results in CI Azure Pipeline

- Go to Azure pipeline edit page
- Search for task `code coverage` and Add this task to your pipeline.

![](https://i.imgur.com/LAbXQiw.png)

- Select `Cobertura`
- Summary file `$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/coverage/**/*.cobertura-coverage.xml`
  ![](https://i.imgur.com/jbax5hT.png)

```yaml
# Publish Code Coverage Results
- task: PublishCodeCoverageResults@1
inputs:
  codeCoverageTool: 'Cobertura'
  summaryFileLocation: '$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/coverage/**/*.xml'
condition: |
  and(
    succeeded(),
    not(contains(
        variables['COMMANDS'],
        '"test":[]'
    ))
  )
```

## Merging Code Coverage in Azure Pipeline for Nx MonoRepo

At present, the code coverage reporting functionality provided by this task is
limited and it does not merge coverage data. If you provide multiple files as
input to the task, only the first match is considered. If you use multiple
publish code coverage tasks in the pipeline, the summary and report is shown for
the last task. Any previously uploaded data is ignored.

I have many code coverage files since I have a MonoRepo. In order to combine all
coverage files I may need some other blog for that so stay tuned.
