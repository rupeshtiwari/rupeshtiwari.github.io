> Site Recovery is very critical now a days. In your own Data-center or Server disasters can happen and you must secure your site to recover from them. Use Microsoft Azure to secure you on-premises machine today. Learn the failover and failback stages in Site Recovery on Azure. Learn **Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery** (BCDR) strategy in Azure.

## Setup On-Premises Replication to Azure VM

Before even failover to Azure VM from on-premises machine make sure you have setup your replication to Azure VM.

After replication is setup to Azure VM follow this workflow to accomplish Site Recovery in 4 steps.

## Failover and failback in Site Recovery has four stages

Let's learn all the 4 steps required for site recovery.

### Stage 1: Fail over from on-premises

After setting up replication to Azure for on-premises machines, when your on-premises site goes down, you fail those machines over to Azure. After failover, Azure VMs are created from replicated data.

### Stage 2: Reprotect Azure VMs

![](https://imgur.com/gvHDxgL.png){: .full}

In Azure, you reprotect the Azure VMs so that they start replicating back to the on-premises site. The on-premises VM (if available) is turned off during reprotection, to help ensure data consistency.

### Stage 3: Fail over from Azure

![](https://imgur.com/3jBsHvL.png){: .full}

When your on-premises site is running as normal again, you run another failover, this time to fail back Azure VMs to your on-premises site. You can fail back to the original location from which you failed over, or to an alternate location.

### Stage 4: Reprotect on-premises machines

After failing back, again enable replication of the on-premises machines to Azure.
