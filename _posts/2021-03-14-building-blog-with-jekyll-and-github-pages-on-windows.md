## Install required Packages for windows on Jekyll site

You have to add many other dependencies for windows. Add below dependencies in your `gemfile`

```yaml=
# Windows and JRuby does not include zoneinfo files, so bundle the tzinfo-data gem
# and associated library.
platforms :mingw, :x64_mingw, :mswin, :jruby do
  gem "tzinfo", "~> 1.2"
  gem "tzinfo-data"
end

# Performance-booster for watching directories on Windows
gem "wdm", "~> 0.1.1", :platforms => [:mingw, :x64_mingw, :mswin]


gem "webrick", "~> 1.7"
```

Go to the root of project
