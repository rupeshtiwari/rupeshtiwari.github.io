> Do you want to schedule your `Jekyll` blog post to be published on GitHub
> Pages on future date time? Then read this article.

## Introduction

Jekyll static site hosted on GitHub Pages doesn't come with schedule blog post
for future feature.

In this article, I will write a job to automatically post future blog posts and
send email after successful post.

## Creating GitHub workflow for publishing future post

We will create one workflow that will run every day and it will publish the post
for future dates.

1. Create your one
   [GitHub Secrete key call it GH_TOKEN](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository).
2. Add `future:false` in `_config.yml` ![](https://i.imgur.com/7iQYpRf.png)
3. Create `schedule-posts.yml` in `.github\workflows` folder. Add below script.
   [Learn more about cron event](https://jasonet.co/posts/scheduled-actions/)
   ![](https://i.imgur.com/V5kHyHe.png)

```yml
name: Build every hour

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * *" # Run at the end of every day.
jobs:
  curl:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: curl
        uses: wei/curl@master
        with:
          args:
            "-X POST -H 'Authorization: token ${{ secrets.PAGES_ACCESS_TOKEN }}'
            -H 'Accept: application/vnd.github.ant-man-preview+json'
            https://api.github.com/repos/YourUserName/YourRepository/pages/builds"
```

4. See how I wrote mine workflow.
5. You are all set now you can create a post for future date and your post will
   be published on that date. ![](https://i.imgur.com/7OXjxpa.png)

6. If you run the Jekyll at local machine you will notice that your new post is
   not getting published immediately. It will skip those posts to publish.

7. This post will be published only when the date will come.

## Sending e-mail on successful blog publish

I will use Gmail user id and password to send automatic email once blog publish
is done.

1. Create `MAIL_USERNAME` and `MAIL_PASSWORD` GitHub secretes
   ![](https://i.imgur.com/R6opFJb.png)

2. Add below script to send email.

```yaml
- name: Send email
  uses: dawidd6/action-send-mail@v2.4.0
  with:
    server_address: smtp.googlemail.com
    server_port: 465
    username: ${{secrets.MAIL_USERNAME}}
    password: ${{secrets.MAIL_PASSWORD}}
    subject: Publishing Blog
    # Literal body:
    body: Build job of ${{github.repository}} completed successfully!
    to: fullstackmaster1@gmail.com
    from: GitHub Blog Repo
```

Change email Id and names.

3. Here is my
   [schedule-post file from master branch.](https://github.com/rupeshtiwari/rupeshtiwari.github.io/blob/master/.github/workflows/schedule-posts.yml)

You are all set now!
