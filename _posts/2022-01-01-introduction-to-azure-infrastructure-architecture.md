> Understanding Azure architecture gives you power to learn lots of higher level concepts on Azure like Virtual Machine scale sets etc. Therefore, in this article you will learn what is Azure overall architecture and its individual components like region, zones, data-centers etc.

## Azure Infrastructure Architecture

- [Geography](#azure-geography) consists of many regions
- Each [Region](#azure-regions) must have minimum 3 Availability Zones.
- Each [Availability Zone](#availability-zone) can have one or more Data Centers equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking.
- No two zones can share a data center.
- Each [Data-Center](#azure-data-center) has Availability Sets
- Each [Availability Set](#what-is-availability-set) can have 3 Fault Domains & up to 20 Update Domain
- [Fault Domain](#what-is-azure-fault-domain) is grouping of virtual machines, independent network switch and power supply provides hardware fault tolerance.
- [Update Domain](#what-is-update-domain-in-azure) is logical grouping of virtual machine and included hardware that can be updated and rebooted at one time.

## Azure Geography

[Azure Geography](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/geographies/#geographies) contains most of the countries in the world.

## What is Azure Regions?

Each Geography has multiple Regions. Example The United States has regions like Center US, East US, East US2, East US3, North Central US, South Central US, West Central US, West US, West US 2, West US 3.

## What is Availability Zone in Azure?

Azure Availability Zones are **physically and logically separated datacenters** with their own **independent power source, network, and cooling**. Connected with an extremely low-latency network, they become a building block to delivering high availability applications. Availability Zones ensure that if there's an event impacting a datacenter siteâ€”for example, if someone cuts the power, or there are issues with coolingâ€”your data will be protected.

Running a VM with one or more replicated copies on different **Availability Zones**, providing resiliency against data center failure.

## Azure Data-Center

In the Data Center the servers are divided into multiple physical and logical groups.

## What is Availability Set?

![](https://imgur.com/FmgxQu5.png){: .full}

An [availability set](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/availability-set-overview) is a logical grouping of VMs that allows Azure to understand how your application is built to provide for redundancy and availability.

## What is azure fault domain?

The physical grouping of servers (virtual machines) is called Fault Domain. It is Each server share a common power source and network switch within a Fault Domain. A fault domain is a set of hardware components that share a single point of failure.

## What is update domain in Azure?

An **update domain** is a logical group of underlying hardware that can undergo maintenance or be rebooted at the same time. As you create VMs within an availability set, the Azure platform automatically distributes your VMs across these **update domains**.

## Azure SLA

Azure Availability Zone give maximum industry best 99.99% of availability.

| High availability and redundancy | Manually create Availability set or distribute and track VMs across Availability Zones | Automatic distribution of VM instances across Availability Zones or Availability Sets |
| Scaling of VMs                   | Manual monitoring and Azure Automation                                                 | Auto scale based on host metrics, in-guest metrics, Application Insights, or schedule |
