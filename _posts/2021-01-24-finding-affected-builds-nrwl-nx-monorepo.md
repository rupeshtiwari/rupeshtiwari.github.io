> In this article, I will explain how to know which applications or libraries
> are changed in your [nx monorepo workspace](https://nx.dev).

## First time building Nx Monorepo

First Time if you get the source from repo to your local machine and run.

`npm run affected:build`

Notice all of the applications and library projects will build.

Once the build is done Nx will remember which projects are compiled
successfully.

Next change the `log.service.ts` inside logger project in branding service.

## Affected Dependency Graph in Nx Monorepo

Next lets check the dependency graph to know which are the apps and libraries
affected by our changes.

Run `npm run affected:dep-graph` ![](https://i.imgur.com/e7bnd0Z.png)

See it is showing we have change `logger` project and it is being used in
`customer-user-editor` and `onlinestore-admin` so all of these applications and
projects are affected.

Nx can identify which are the projects changed. Which is great!

## Build only Affected Projects in Nx Monorepo

Now you can run below script to just build affected projects only.

Run `npm run affected:build`

Notice it is only building affected projects only.

That give us performance while developing since we only build and test the
projects that we change.
