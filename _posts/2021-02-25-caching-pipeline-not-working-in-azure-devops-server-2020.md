> Artifacts caching does not work on-premise **Azure DevOps Server 2020**. The [Azure DevOps documentation on Cache Action](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/utility/cache?view=azure-devops) is not updated and that is misleading.

## Cache@2 utility Not working on premise Azure DevOps

You will get below error when you use `cache@2` in your pipeline. Here is the [Microsoft GitHub Issue](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks/issues/13937). It clearly says that, `Cache@2` task is not supported on-premises. It works on Azure DevOps though however not work on Azure DevOps On-Premise Server.

```
'API resource location is not registered' error with Azure pipeline cache task
```

[Reead: Stack overflow error](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65187680/getting-api-resource-location-is-not-registered-error-with-azure-pipeline-cach)

## Why Cache@2 is not working in DevOps Server

Microsoft DevOps Server does not support `Universal Packages` that is why `node_module` caching in pipeline does not work using `cache@2` or any `Universal Packages`.

Currently, [Universal Packages are only available for Azure DevOps Services](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/1223753/availability-of-universal-packages-in-azure-devops.html).

## When cache is included?

It seems by March it will be done as per [Microsoft GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-pipelines-yaml/pull/113).
