> **Blob Storage** is helpful to upload images, videos, documents, pdfs etc. over the Azure cloud. In order to create new **Azure Blob Storage**. You must need to [create Azure Storage Account](https://rupeshtiwari.com/creating-azure-storage-account/). Because Azure **Blob Storage** is one of the **services** of the Azure** Storage Account**.

## Prerequisite 👍

{: .notice--warning}
You must have below things ready before creating Azure Blob storage.

- Azure Account
- Azure Storage Account: [Learn how to create Azure Storage account here](https://rupeshtiwari.com/creating-azure-storage-account/).

## Introduction 💁

### Settings

Storage Account has lots of settings related to implementing **security and network access**.

### Blob Service

## New Container 🥃

You need to create **at-least one container** for uploading a file. While Creating Container you must give **name** and setup **public access level**.

### Public Access Level

**Weather** the blobs are **accessible** by **anonymous** or not. While [creating storage account](https://rupeshtiwari.com/creating-azure-storage-account/) if you turn off the public access at **account** level then that settings will **override** the **container public access** level.

#### Private

Default settings is private. That means **authentication** is **required** either accessing via **browsers** or **REST APIs**.

#### Blob

This is anonymous read access for blobs

#### Container

This is anonymous read access for both containers and blobs

### Advanced

You can choose to **encrypt** the **data** using the **default** which is the **encryption key** for the **storage account**.

#### Encryption Scope

Or use the encryption scope just for **this container data** that encryption key can be managed by **Microsoft** or you can use **your own key** stored in the **Azure Key Vault**.

## Uploading blobs 🥙

Any type of the files can be uploaded from your computer.

### Advanced

#### Authentication type

![](https://imgur.com/VJ39N4H.png)

Should authenticate using an **Account key** or using **role in Azure AD user account**. The recommended one is Azure AD account key.

#### Blob type

##### Block blob

Block blob is the default blob type. While uploading blobs are **broken down** in to **smaller unit** that are called **blocks**. Since blocks are smaller units you get some benefits listed below:

- upload **speed** can become faster
- upload works on **low bandwidth** internet connection
- **parallelly** blocks can be **uploaded** while uploading blob from user machine to Azure.

Once upload is done then Azure will **assemble** them to make a **final blob**.

##### Page blob

- page blob is a **collection** of **512 byte** pages.
- good for **random read or write** operations.
- **add** or **update** content happens by **writing** page blobs.
- Azure infrastructure **VMs disk** are using **page file** as the foundation.
- Example: **large** `video` files, or `.vhd` (disk for virtual machines) files should be uploaded as page blob.

##### Append blob

- Append blob is also **composed** of **blocks**.
- However, these blocks are optimized to only **append(add) at the end of the blob** while assembling.
- **Update** and **Delete** existing **blocks** is **not** supported when you choose append blob.
- Example: **Log files** must be stored as append blob.

#### Block size

you can choose the block size from **64 KB to 100 MB**.

#### Access tier

![](https://imgur.com/49K6BaF.png)

You can select your blob access tier while uploading blob. **Hot** tier is the **default** one.

#### Upload to a folder

It will put the folder name on the path of the blob path. It will be the real folder if you select [hierarchical namespace while creating your azure account](https://rupeshtiwari.com/creating-azure-storage-account/#hierarchical-namespace).

#### Encryption scope

## Blob properties 🦜

After uploading blob you can see the properties.

### Overview

Here you can overview the details of the blob and check all metadata keys and add more metadata keys.

### Versions

If you turned on versioning then you can see the versions here.

### Edit

Some of the files like `.txt` can be edited right in the azure portal.

### Snapshots

You can create a **copy** of the current version and mark them as snapshot which can be downloaded or promoted as the current version or deleted if not required.

### Generating SAS

Shared Access Signature (SAS) is a **string** appended at the **end of the URL** for **accessing** a blob file.

## Actions at Container Level 🕵️‍♂️

From the container list you can select the action per container level.

- **Acquire lease** : No one can delete this container
- **Change access level** : You can change the public access level at container level.
