If you have a blogging site using **Jekyll** and you want to publish your blogs
to your **[Dev.To](https://dev.to)** account? Then read this article.

## Jekyll Project

I have my Jekyll project and I do have 1 post and I want this post to be
automatically published to my **[Dev.To](https://dev.to)** account when I push
this post to GitHub. Really excited about that so lets begin.

## Publish to dev.to Action

I will use pre-built action by
[sinedied/publish-devto](https://github.com/sinedied/publish-devto) to publish
my post to dev.to.

## dev.to Front Matter Guidelines

Make sure you have below attributes in your blog post Front Matter.

Custom variables set for each post, located between the triple-dashed lines in
your editor. Here is a list of possibilities:

**title**: the title of your article **published**: boolean that determines
whether or not your article is published **description**: description area in
Twitter cards and open graph cards **tags**: max of four tags, needs to be
comma-separated **canonical_url**: link for the canonical version of the content
**cover_image**: cover image for post, accepts a URL. The best size is 1000
x 420. **series**: post series name.

### ‚úç Markdown Basics

Below are some examples of commonly used markdown syntax. If you want to dive
deeper, check out
[this cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet).

## Creating API Keys in Dev.To

## Creating Github Workflow

Lets create ".github/workflows/publish.yml" file.

![](https://i.imgur.com/UOlHCHi.png)

It will publish post to dev.to/roopkt whenever merge or push happens to master
branch.

```yaml=
name: publish
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: "! contains(toJSON(github.event.commits.*.message), '[skip ci]')"

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: 12

    - name: Publish articles on dev.to
      uses: "sinedied/publish-devto@30728bf"
      with:
        files: '_posts/**/*.md'
        devto_key: ${{ secrets.DEVTO_TOKEN }}
github_token: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
conventional_commits: true
```

## Run GitHub CI/CD

Lets update post and push the code to master branch.

## Confirm published article on dev.to account

Notice my post published in https://dev.to/roopkt

Here is my article published :
["Enforcing Dependency Constraints in Nx Monorepo Projects"](https://dev.to/roopkt/enforcing-dependency-constraints-in-nx-monorepo-projects-3ldj)

## Skipping GitHub CI

Sometime you are not updating your blog rather fixing your site or updating
about me or something else. And you don't want to trigger your CI so make sure
you add `[skip ci]` in your commit comments. So that your blogs will be not
published because CI will not trigger.

Notice we have check in our Job to not run if message has '[skip ci]'
