## Creating Github Workflow

Lets create ".github/workflows/publish.yml" file.

![](https://i.imgur.com/UOlHCHi.png)

It will publish post to dev.to/roopkt whenever merge or push happens to master branch.

```yaml=
name: publish
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: "! contains(toJSON(github.event.commits.*.message), '[skip ci]')"

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: 12

    - name: Publish articles on dev.to
      uses: "sinedied/publish-devto@30728bf"
      with:
        files: '_posts/**/*.md'
        devto_key: ${{ secrets.DEVTO_TOKEN }}
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
        conventional_commits: true
```

## Run GitHub CI/CD

Lets update post and push the code to master branch.

Here is my article published : ["Enforcing Dependency Constraints in Nx Monorepo Projects"](https://dev.to/roopkt/enforcing-dependency-constraints-in-nx-monorepo-projects-3ldj)

## Skipping GitHub CI

Sometime you are not updating your blog rather fixing your site or updating about me or something else. And you don't want to trigger your CI so make sure you add `[skip ci]` in your commit comments. So that your blogs will be not published because CI will not trigger.

Notice we have check in our Job to not run if message has '[skip ci]'
