<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I am very excited to announce that I became an author in <a href="http://pluralsight.com">Pluralsight.com</a> and my first course on Unit Testing with RxJS Marble Diagram is going to be published soon on 2019.</p>
<p>Please take some time out and consider watching my course. I hope you will enjoy and learn RxJS Marble Testing.</p>
