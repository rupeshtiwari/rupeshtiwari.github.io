  <h2>Introduction: My Journey</h2>
  <p>I grew up in a small town in India with no money for education. I sold eggs and bread door-to-door to pay my school fees. I worked as a waiter through college. Everything was stacked against me.</p>
  <p>But here's what happened: I became the school topper. I taught myself programming. I got my first job as a JavaScript developer. And then I kept climbing.</p>
  <p><strong>Today, I'm a Senior Customer Solutions Manager at AWS.</strong> I've passed interviews at Google, Microsoft, and AWS. And I've coached 50+ Directors, VPs, and Principal Engineers to land FAANG offers with an average $285K compensation increase.</p>
  <p>This guide contains the exact frameworks I used and teach. No fluff. No generic advice. Just what works.</p>

  <h2>Secret #1: The Leadership Narrative Framework</h2>
  <p>The #1 mistake senior engineers make is treating interviews like coding tests. At the Director+ level, you're being evaluated on something completely different: <strong>can you lead?</strong></p>
  
  <h3>The SPIRE Framework</h3>
  <div class="framework">
    <h4>S - Situation</h4>
    <p>Set the context in 2-3 sentences. What was the business challenge? What was at stake?</p>
    
    <h4>P - Problem</h4>
    <p>What specific problem did YOU identify? Show strategic thinking here.</p>
    
    <h4>I - Initiative</h4>
    <p>What did YOU do? Focus on YOUR leadership actions, not what the team did.</p>
    
    <h4>R - Results</h4>
    <p>Quantify the impact. Revenue, cost savings, efficiency gains, team growth.</p>
    
    <h4>E - Evolution</h4>
    <p>What did you learn? How did this shape your leadership philosophy?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tip">
    <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Prepare 8-10 SPIRE stories covering different leadership dimensions: hiring, firing, conflict resolution, technical decisions, failure, ambiguity, cross-team collaboration, and innovation.
  </div>

  <h2>Secret #2: System Design for Senior Roles</h2>
  <p>Senior-level system design is NOT about drawing boxes and arrows. It's about demonstrating you can make trade-offs and justify decisions.</p>
  
  <h3>The 4-Step Framework</h3>
  <div class="framework">
    <h4>Step 1: Clarify Requirements (5 minutes)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Functional requirements: What must the system do?</li>
      <li>Non-functional requirements: Scale, latency, availability</li>
      <li>Constraints: Budget, timeline, existing systems</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Step 2: High-Level Design (10 minutes)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Draw the major components</li>
      <li>Explain data flow</li>
      <li>Identify APIs</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Step 3: Deep Dive (15 minutes)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Pick 2-3 components to detail</li>
      <li>Discuss trade-offs explicitly</li>
      <li>Address scale challenges</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Step 4: Wrap-Up (5 minutes)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Summarize key decisions</li>
      <li>Mention what you'd do with more time</li>
      <li>Discuss monitoring and operations</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Secret #3: The 5 Behavioral Questions Everyone Asks</h2>
  <p>These 5 questions appear in 90% of senior interviews. Have a strong SPIRE story ready for each.</p>

  <div class="framework">
    <p class="question">1. Tell me about yourself.</p>
    <p>This is NOT a resume walkthrough. Use the Present-Past-Future formula: Where you are now → 2-3 career highlights → Why you're excited about this role.</p>
    
    <p class="question">2. Tell me about a time you failed.</p>
    <p>Pick a real failure. Show self-awareness. Focus 80% on what you learned and how you improved.</p>
    
    <p class="question">3. Tell me about a conflict with a colleague.</p>
    <p>Never badmouth anyone. Show how you sought to understand their perspective first.</p>
    
    <p class="question">4. Describe a time you made a decision without complete information.</p>
    <p>This tests your ability to handle ambiguity. Show your decision-making framework.</p>
    
    <p class="question">5. Why do you want to work here?</p>
    <p>Research the company's challenges. Connect your experience to their needs specifically.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Secret #5: Salary Negotiation Scripts</h2>
  <p>My clients have added $50K-$150K to their offers using these exact scripts.</p>

  <div class="highlight">
    <h4>Script 1: When They Give First Offer</h4>
    <p>"Thank you for the offer. I'm very excited about this opportunity. Based on my research and the value I'll bring, I was expecting something closer to [X]. Is there flexibility in the base salary?"</p>
  </div>

  <div class="highlight">
    <h4>Script 2: Competing Offers</h4>
    <p>"I have another offer at [X] total comp. [Your company] is my first choice, but I need the numbers to work. Can you match or come closer to that package?"</p>
  </div>

  <div class="highlight">
    <h4>Script 3: Signing Bonus</h4>
    <p>"I understand there may be constraints on base salary. Would a signing bonus be possible to bridge the gap?"</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tip">
    <strong>Golden Rule:</strong> Never accept on the spot. Always say "Thank you, I need a few days to review this with my family."
  </div>
